         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:118706:3"/> can lightly indite, have notwithſtanding, been a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and offence unto them.

            <p>I call God for a record upon my ſoul, that I have<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> not the leaſt touch of any malignancie or froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit againſt any of you, but can freely ſerve the meaneſt of you in love, yea, and ſtoop to looſe the latcher of his ſhoe, who is the moſt jealous amongſt you of the candor and ſimplicitie of my heart towards you. Yea I have upon occaſion, and this more than once, given a very paſſeable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my unpartiall reſpects unto all of your way and practiſe worthy the repute of godlineſs, by gird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf, and miniſtring with all my might to ſome particulars of you. But I know how hard a thing it is not to be offended with him, that ſhall touch the Apple of a mans eye, or that ſhall attempt to change the glorie and height of his confidence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſhame of guilt and errour. And the truth is, that you have much obſtructed the way of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and regainment unto the Truth, by an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and undue magnifying of your errour. If you could have been content, in eſtimating your new Baptiſm, and the want or non-practiſe of it in others, to contain you ſelves within thoſe bounds of Reaſon and Truth, which the Holy Ghoſt preſcrib's in a like (or rather indeed in a far better) caſe, ſaying, That <hi>Circumciſion is nothing, and uncircumciſion is nothing, but the keeping the Commandments of God;</hi>

And if my intelligence faileth me not, other of your Churches are lifting up their hearts to a like zealous exaltation of your way, as by proſcribing or evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating all the Faith, Love, Zeal, Holineſs, Meekneſs, Humility, Wiſdom, and Knowledge, ſhining in the Chriſtian world, which ſhall not approve themſelves unto you, by falling down before the golden image which you have ſet up.</p>
            <p>But in this your humour of making ſuch ſacred<note place="margin">§ 4.</note> treaſure of your new Baptiſm, you declare your ſelves to be the true heirs and ſucceſſors of thoſe in all ages, who have unduly, and without cauſe, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the bands of Unity, Love, and Peace, wherein they had ſomtimes been bound up in the ſame bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of Chriſtianity with other Churches, to walk in ſome by-way of particular choyce by themſelves, to the offence, grief, and reproach of thoſe Churches from which they rent themſelves, and renounced Communion with, upon ſuch an account. It hath alwaies been the manner of perſons of that character, to magnifie above meaſure that opinion, or practiſe, of what ſlender conſequence, nay of what evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence ſoever it was, wherein they diſſented from, and for the non-profeſſion, or non-practiſe whereof, they rejected the communion of other Churches. The Hiſtory of the Church ſince the Apoſtles days affordeth us inſtances without number of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port we ſpeak of: ſome of theſe are preſented to the Readers conſideration in the enſuing diſcourſe <note n="b" place="margin">pag 8, 9, 10.</note>. By theſe inſtances, and many more of like ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:118706:4"/> which might readily have been added to them, it clearly appears, that when men make any defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or rent, from the main body of ſound <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in any thing, whether opinion, or practiſe, they are ſtrongly tempted by the ſpirit of this ſeparation, to ſpeak, how extravagantly or cauſleſly ſoever, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things of that, wherein they differ (be it opinion or practiſe) leſt otherwiſe their departure from the houſhold of Faith, ſhould ſeem cauſleſs, and (ſo) highly cenſurable. And that men of your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practiſe have not been behind the Patrons of the Errors ſpecified in the ſaid page and ſection of the preſent Diſcourſe, in crying <hi>Hoſanna in the higheſt</hi> to your way, appears ſufficiently from the beſt records that are extant, of thoſe times, wherein this way firſt got footing in the <hi>Europoean</hi> parts of the Chriſtian world. <hi>John Sleidan</hi> in his hiſtorical Commentaries, amongſt many other ſad relations of your Predeceſſors, reports of one, who <hi>ran up and down the City of Munſter, as if he had been inſpired from God, crying out, Repent, and be re-baptized; if ye will not, the wrath of God will preſently overwhelm you. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the common ſort of people began to make a tumult: and whoſoever was re-baptized, clamour'd out the ſame things which the other did, and after the ſame manner. Many, fearing the wrath of God, which theſe men ſo loudly boaſted</hi> [would fall upon all thoſe that would not be re-baptized] <hi>being through their ſimplicity circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented (men otherwiſe not evil) did as they would have them</hi> [and were re-baptized] <hi>ſome alſo, that they might keep their eſtates.

<pb facs="tcp:118706:5"/> this day amongſt us not a few of your judgement and way, who ſpeak not much ſhort of theſe <hi>Munſter-Anabaptiſts,</hi> concerning the high neceſſity of your way of baptizing. This paſſage extant p. 18. of the Diſcourſe examined in the enſuing Treatiſe, [<hi>That both Repentance, and the declaration of it by Baptiſm</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">He mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth only that kind of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm which himſelf own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage relateth little to his purpoſe.</note>, <hi>is required on mans part, to intereſs him in remiſſion of ſins, and ſanctification of the Spirit, the things cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted or promiſed on Gods part, is too evident to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by any, but thoſe that will not ſee, from Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39.] This paſſage (I ſay, which hath ſeveral other confederate with it in the Diſcourſe) is of the ſame inſpiration with the <hi>Munſter</hi>-Divinity lately recited, expoſing all thoſe to the eternal wrath of God, who ſhall not be baptized, <hi>ſecundum modum Authoris,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of the Authors own Baptiſme. And if your Scribes and Wiſe-men ſpeak thus gloriouſly of your way, can we think that your vulgar proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes are beneath them in their thoughts about it? But I look upon theſe high thoughts which you take unto your ſelves, as alſo thoſe great words, wherein you expreſs your ſelves unto others, concerning your way, like the men of <hi>Epheſus</hi> concerning their <hi>Diana, Great is Diana of the Epheſians;</hi> not as argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or grounds of any regular or rational convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon your judgements and conſciences, that there is any ſuch either weight or worth in your way; but rather as ſtudied and ſtrained Apologies, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe your ſelves, as well unto your ſelves, and your own conſciences, as unto others, for your otherwiſe inexcuſable ſeparation, and offence hereby given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But what, or how high ſoever, or how occaſioned<note place="margin">§ 5.</note> ſoever, your thoughts are concerning your Baptiſme,
<pb facs="tcp:118706:5"/> I truſt you retain ſo much ſavour of that anointing with the ſpirit of wiſdom and meekneſs, which you received under that Baptiſme (for ſo we judge of it, and as yet are not apprehenſive of any ſufficient ground to judge otherwiſe) wherewith you were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized after the manner practiſed in other Churches, as not to ſtumble at that ſtone which the Apoſtle hath faithfully endeavoured to remove out of your way, by demanding thus of the <hi>Galathians, Am I therefore becom your enemy, becauſe I tell you the truth?</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 4. 16.</note> Doubtleſs this Apoſtle did not bewray the leaſt touch or tincture of any enmity, either againſt the Church of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> or againſt the perſons themſelves of whom he ſpake, when he ſaid; <hi>Many there are, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the croſs of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Phil. 3. 18.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And my hope is, at leaſt concerning you whom I ſtile the ſons and daughters of God, that what I ſhall out of an unfainedly compaſſionate ſoul towards you, with truth ſpeak unto you, whether relating to your ſelves, or others of your judgement and way, only in order to your ſpiritual good, ſhall not be wreſted or drawn aſide by you to any ſiniſter or hard Interpretation, as if I were a man, who rather ſought your diſcredit and diſparagement in the world, then your edification in the truth. I well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the dear intereſt of my comfort and peace ſtandeth, not in the pulling down, but in the building up the comforts and peace of other men. Nor have I any Tower of Name or Reputation to build for my ſelf in the world, that I ſhould ſtand in need of the ruines, or demoliſhed ſtones, either of yours, or any other mens, to advance my building.
<pb facs="tcp:118706:6"/> As I have none, ſo neither do I ſeek or deſire any other honour, then that which cometh from God only. I have given ſufficient hoſtages unto the world, that I ſhall never war upon it, or be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome unto it, for neglecting me, or laying my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the duſt. He, who (it ſeems) believeth that I was tempted into a way of Schiſme, by mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate zeal againſt my Treatiſe of Juſtification, is a ſtranger unto me, and thinketh accordingly. But that which he calleth <hi>Schiſme,</hi> is ſchiſme only ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; unleſs to ſeparate from iniquity, be <hi>ſchiſm.</hi> But however, the moſt intemperate zeal of men againſt me, Perſon, Name, or Books, is a temptation of a very faint influence upon me to turn me out of any way of Truth, yea, or to make me their enemy. Only when the Truth is offended, I confeſs I burn; and in caſe I find any ſtrength in my hand to redreſs the injury done to it, I have no reſt in my ſpirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til I have attempted the Vindication. By <hi>Truth,</hi> I do not mean mine own opinion (as you ſeem frequently to underſtand the word, in reference unto yours) for as for that which is no more then ſo, I ſhall neither trouble my ſelf much, nor any other man at al, about it. But by <hi>Truth</hi> I mean, ſuch a doctrine or notion, one or more, which I certainly know that I am able to demonſtrate either from the Scriptures, or from clear principles and grounds in Reaſon, or both, to be agreeable to the mind of God. And of this ſort is the Doctrine concerning the ſubject of Baptiſme, and the mode of the adminiſtration thereof, avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Aphoriſms, and vindicated in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer enſuing, againſt the moſt plauſible Arguments (I believe) that have yet appeared on your ſide.</p>
            <p>Some particulars there are, relating to your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">§. 6.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:118706:6"/> and practiſe about Baptiſme, which, as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be judged loyal and faithful unto <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> true to the dear intereſt of your own comfort and peace, friends to the comforts and peace of the Churches of <hi>Chriſt</hi> throughout the world, I earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire you will pleaſe to take into your cloſeſt and moſt Chriſtian conſideration. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether, in your rejecting all children from the Baptiſme of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> you do not forſake the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and guidance, as well of the fair and goodly ſtream of religious and learned Antiquity, as of the main current of the ſignal abilities, gifts, parts, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, piety, zeal, practiſe of modern times, to turn into the by-notions, conceits, and ways of men, who are, and ſtill have been, children in underſtanding, (at leaſt comparatively) inexpert in the word of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, through the weakneſs of their ſight not able to ſee things afar off, or to diſcern or diſcover the minde of <hi>Christ,</hi> if it be but ſpiritually expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; I mean, in ſuch phraſe or words, wherein the holy Ghoſt delighteth, and not put into terms and words of their preſcription, and ſuch as they judge meet it ſhould have been, had he intended to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey it unto men by the Scriptures? Or whether any one man, of any conſiderable note, or name, for might in the Scriptures, in all the golden Regiment of Reformed Divines, or amongſt perſons of any other capacity, ſince the Reformation, hath given the right hand of fellowſhip unto you in the way of your judgement (ſuch only excepted, who upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and better thoughts withdrew it again from you) yea or hath ſo much as at unawares, or in any traverſe or debate of any other ſubject in Chriſtian Religion, aſſerted any thing, or let fall a
<pb facs="tcp:118706:7"/> word, in countenance of that your judgement, of which I ſpeak? Yea, whether they have not (gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally) upon occaſion, moſt ſolemnly and ſeriouſly declared againſt your opinion and practiſe, ſhewing and proving the inconveniences, and evil conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of them; And whether, the affirmative in all their demands ſuppoſed, it doth not plainly argue, 1. That your opinion about Baptiſme, is of a very ignoble and obſcure race and parentage. 2. That it carrieth nothing at all in it, ſtandeth upon no principles or grounds any ways neceſſary or uſeful, either for the proof, illuſtration, or clearing of any Doctrine in Chriſtian Religion?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether Errors and Hereſies have not their<note place="margin">§ 7.</note> certain ſeaſons of growth and infection, as wherein they are with greater diligence and induſtry diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and more readily learned and drunk in by the generality of people; even as ſome hurtful Plants<note place="margin">

And whether the errors and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies of the <hi>Nicholaitans,</hi> of <hi>Cerinthus, Manes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonius, Arrius, Eutyches,</hi> and others both of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and of later times, have not prevailed (reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively) in thoſe times and ages, for which the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Providence of God judged them meet tryals and ſcourges for his Churches? And further, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as once the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world, was on a ſudden,
<pb facs="tcp:118706:7"/> and to its own admiration, under a deluge of <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſme,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Miratus eſt Orbis ſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum Arria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> which notwithſtanding was, through the gracious Providence of God, not long after dryed up again; ſo it be not extremely probable, that the face of theſe parts of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world, at preſent overſpread and covered with a Land-flood of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſme, to the wonderment, not only of intelligent and conſidering men, but (I ſuppoſe) of the perſons themſelves alſo led aſide with the error, will, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great prevailing of theſe unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome waters hitherto, through the merciful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God towards his Churches and Servants in this Nation, be diſcharged of them, and that he will cauſe them to return and fall back again into that <hi>Mare Mortuum,</hi> or lake from whence they, and all other waters of like danger and annoyance with them, iſſue forth into the world.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether the generality, or far greater part of<note place="margin">§ 8.</note> thoſe, who take upon them to be guides and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in your Congregations, and Aſſemblies, be not utterly incompetent and unmeet for ſuch an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, as being deplorably ignorant of the myſterie of Chriſt, not able to divide the word aright, nor to wield and manage the Scriptures, eſpecially where the deep things of God are treaſured up, but with unſpeakable detriment and loſs to the Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and conſequently to the ſolid peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, of thoſe who depend upon them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether the Doctrines, or at leaſt the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Doctrines, that are handled and taught in your Congregations, be not rais'd upon miſtaken ſenſes, and perverted meanings of the Scriptures, unto which they pretend; yea, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged upon weak, irrelative, and impertinent
<pb facs="tcp:118706:8"/> grounds, and either wholly miſ-applyed, or elſe ſo weakly and looſely applyed, that they leave no weighty, no effectual or lively impreſſion of their truth, or import, upon the ſpirits and conſciences of the hearers?</p>
            <p n="5">5.

And whether the principal, if not the only cement and band, that keeps and holds your Churches and Congregations together, be not the ſimple conceit that you are, by means of your new Baptiſme, gotten neerer to God, and deeper in his favour then other men, how holy or worthy ſoever otherwiſe above your ſelves?</p>
            <p n="6">6.

            <p n="8">8. Whether a very great number (at leaſt) of thoſe, who have done homage to your way, and have bowed down their judgements and conſciences unto it, have not been ſpiritual loſers by the change,

And whether you your ſelves, in ſeveral of your Congregations, are not experimentally ſenſible of ſuch a frequent declining and putrifying of your Members, as this, caſting out, and cutting off, great numbers of them from day to day?

To fight againſt truth, being interpreted, is little leſs then to fight againſt God: and a madneſs it is for any man to think that ever his ſoul ſhould proſper by ſuch wars. My God and my conſcience, have deeply engaged me in a warfare very troubleſome and coſtly, even to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend (in a manner) with the whole Earth round about me, and to attempt the caſting down of high things, and imaginations in men, which exalt themſelves againſt the knowledge of God. And dayly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſheweth, that mens imaginations, as well thoſe which lift up themſelves againſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, as thoſe of a better and more bleſſed import, are their darlings, and that he that toucheth them, toucheth the Apple of their eye, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, upon the account, in the ſhape or likeneſs of an enemy unto them. The truth is, that to bear the hatred and contradiction of the world, as God hath made it my portion to do, is no whit more pleaſing unto me, then the drinking of that cup, which the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> prayed thrice unto his Father might paſs from him, was unto him. Notwithſtanding as that, which was (in it ſelf) bitter and grievous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, in this reſpect was not grievous at all, but acceptable, <hi>viz.</hi> that by ſuffering it, he might open an effectual door of life, and ſalvation unto the world; ſo doth the vehemencie and zeal of deſire, which poſſeſſeth my reins, heart and ſoul, of doing ſome ſervice to the world, whileſt I am a ſojourner in it, in making ſome of the crooked things thereof,
<pb facs="tcp:118706:12"/> ſtreight, and leaving it at my departure from it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſomewhat better terms for the peace and comfort of it, then I found it at my coming to it, ſwallow up much of that offenſiveneſs and monſtrouſneſs of taſt, wherewith otherwiſe the moſt unreaſonable and horrid meaſure, I receive from many in it, would affect and afflict my ſoul. But to bear the burthen of the hatred of men out of an affection of unfeigned love to them, is nothing more then what I know is my duty to do: and for his ſake, who bear the burthen of my ſins upon the Croſs, out of an unfeigned love to me, and through his grace, I ſhall willingly do it.</p>

They miſcarryed, becauſe they hearkened not unto them, who plainly declared the truth unto them: Oh, ſtumble not you at this ſtone.</p>
            <p>I have detained you with ſomewhat an over-long Epiſtle; but I truſt there is nothing in it, except it be the length, that can offend you. My hope is the ſame concerning the treatiſes enſuing, drawn up with equal reſpects, to the regaining (at leaſt of ſome) of you, from your errour, as for the eſtabliſhing of others in that way of truth, wherein they ſtand. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I was willing to caſt the honour of the Dedication (if there be any ſuch thing as honor in it) appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon you. If you wil pleaſe to read them with a like candid and Chriſtian minde, as that wherewith they were drawn up for your ſervice, I little queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but that through the bleſſing of God, they will recompence your time and labour beſtowed on them. If their acceſs to your judgements and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences be obſtructed with prejudice and conceit, you will will have much more reaſon to complain of your ſelves, then of them, in caſe your reading turn to no account of ſatisfaction unto you. Diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity is the great partition wall, which at this day ſeparates between a world of men, and a world of truth. That Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> book of plain Scripture Proof for Infant-Baptiſm, ſhould have been ſo long extant in the world, and yet Anabaptiſm ſtill alive, is to me a plain demonſtration that the world is ſadly
<pb facs="tcp:118706:14"/> defective in point of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ingenuity. Weakneſs of capacity, ſlowneſs of apprehenſion, darkneſs of underſtanding, averſneſs to conſider, might be all (at leaſt to a very great meaſure) redeemed by an ardent love unto the Truth.

This obvious difference between men and men, of the ſame perſwaſion (as to the point of Ana-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm) induceth me to beleeve, that the great evils which ſo frequently attend it, are not ſo much ſourced in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or complexion of the perſwaſion it felf, as in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſtitution of the greateſt part of thoſe who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with it.

Who are over tender in conſcience, through weakneſs in judgement, and apt to fear ſin, whereno ſin is, or to ſuſpect duty, where no duty is. And 3.

Whereas other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, free from thoſe impreſsions of weakneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthyneſs, although of the ſame Anti-pedo-paptiſmal faith and engagement, pretend not to hear ſo much as the leaſt ayr, or whiſper, of any ſuch exhortation, from ſuch their perſwaſion.</p>
            <p>It is not long ſince my thoughts ſtood within me never<note place="margin">§ 2.</note> to meddle (in print) with theſe Baptiſmal controverſies.
<pb facs="tcp:118706:15"/> I was deeply engaged in others, which were of a much more deſireable reſentment with my genius, and in which I judged my labours might have ſerved the world upon terms of better advantage. Nor had I (I beleeve) ever taken Pen in hand for the defence of Infant-Baptiſm, had not the untimely birth of that diſcourſe, unto which I give anſwer in the latter part of the book now in thy hand, impoſed a moſt unhappy neceſsity upon me thereunto. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding herein I am a little relieved under this ſo un-acceptable an ingagement (for the kind of it) that I ſhall deal with my adverſary (Anabaptiſm) in the glory of his ſtrength; and conſequently upon ſucb terms, that (I truſt) he will never be able to recrute more, or take the field again with any force conſiderable. For (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Tombs,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Fiſher,</hi> who are counted Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of that way, have (comparatively) but trifled in their undertakings for the Rebaptizing cauſe. <hi>W. A.</hi> in his <hi>Baptiſmal Abuſes,</hi> what execution ſoever he hath done upon his Adverſaries, hath quite foyled the pens of his fellow-combatants, by overarguing their line: yea and in his diſcourſe againſt Infant-baptiſm, hath overargued his own line, in what he hath written againſt Church-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Churches, or perſons by him called, <hi>unbaptized.</hi> But the truth is, that the former cauſe wil much better take colours of artifice and wit, then the latter. And our Rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizers (I preſume) would willingly enough give a bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce unto this cauſe, did they know how to exalt and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to their minds, the cauſe of Rebaptizing, without it.</p>
            <p>Amongſt many other unhandſome and unpleaſing ſtreins wherein (generally) the Anabaptiſmal ſpirit uttereth it ſelf in the world, I have both formerly (in part) and more particularly of late, obſerved in perſons led by it, a kind of tedious and effeminate tenderneſs, or frowardneſs, which diſpoſeth them to exceptions and complaints, even
<pb facs="tcp:118706:16"/> where there is not ſo much as the leaſt appearance of any juſt cauſe given for complaining. They cannot allow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſober men, and thoſe who are far from wiſhing, and much farther from doing, them the leaſt harm, their natural genius, or gift of expreſsion, which they have received from God, without quarrelling and cenſuring them for it, if it doth but touch, though never ſo lightly, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-hold (as the common Proverb is) of their way. This Graſhopper of expreſsion (in the Title Page of my <hi>Water-Dipping) after the new mode of dipping,</hi> was (it ſeems) an heavy burthen to the wiſdom and patience of ſome in that way, who for the word <hi>mode,</hi> made me a a tranſgreſſor of no light demerit. Some Grandee's of the way made themſelves agrieved, that <hi>p. 19.</hi> of that diſcourſe, I term a certain water, or pool, commodiouſly contrived, and much frequented and delighted in, by many about the City, dip-wiſe minded, by the name of a <hi>watry Paradiſe.</hi> Yea, and in their Sermons, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it to their Diſciples, as an high ſtrain of perſecution, that <hi>p. 31.</hi> of that diſcourſe, I mention them by this expreſsion, <hi>Brethren of the Dip;</hi> yea and exhort them very zealouſly to ſtand to their tackling, notwithſtanhing ſuch affronts and horrid indignities put upon them. Whereas the truth is, that in that expreſsion I intended them not the leaſt touch of diſparagement; but having ſpent my ſtore of other expreſſions whereby to diſtinguiſh them, and wore many of them thrid ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Sam. Fiſher,</hi> (who I am confident) will juſtifie me in

            <p>Some of them, are not (I confeſs) ſo much offended, as triumphantly apaid, yet quarrelſom-wiſe too, that becauſe Mr <hi>A.</hi> my Antagoniſt uſeth the word, <hi>Such,</hi> where he hath occaſion, yea and a kind of neceſſity to uſe it in his writing, I do not uſe it in mine where I have no occaſion at all to uſe it, yea, where it would make little better then non-ſenſe to inſert it. And becauſe I charge the ſix Bookſellers with diſ-ingenuity in tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing a paſſage of mine without the word, <hi>Such,</hi> being a word of an emphatical import in the ſentence, the men I ſpeak of, admire the juſt hand of providence lifted up againſt me, that I ſhould be left to omit the word, <hi>Such,</hi> not in tranſcribing the words of my Antagoniſt (for here I expreſs it, as oft, and as plainly, as himſelf; but in a paſsage of mine own, where (it ſeems) they fancy, I ſhould have expreſſed it; when as to a man of ordinary underſtanding, and who knows any thing belonging to the regular ſtructure of a ſentence, the mention of it would have been needleſs, frivolous, and importune. The Reader, if he pleaſe, may ſee all that is to be ſeen, <hi>of the hand of Providence lifted up againſt me</hi> in the caſe ſpecified, pag. 82. of my <hi>Water-Dipping</hi> &amp;c. in the two laſt lines of the page. Nor is it true, that I quarrelled or cenſured the Bookſellers ſimply, for leaving out the word, <hi>Such,</hi> in their tranſcription of my words, (for this might have been only an overſight) but that being privately informed by me of ſuch their omiſſion, and deſired to repair me by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like acknowledgement of the ſame, they, inſtead here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, gave me Gall and Vinegar to drink, in an anſwer in writing, full of bitter, and un-Chriſtian Invectives, and forged Imputations. So that in caſe I had omitted
<pb facs="tcp:118706:17"/> the word, <hi>Such,</hi> in tranſcribing the words of my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, yet unleſs upon admonition, I ſhould have juſtified it, or upon requeſt, refuſed to acknowledge it, in order to his vindication, there had been no ground for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, which theſe men make between me and the Book-ſellers.</p>
            <p>Some great doers for the way in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm hath, or at leaſt of late had, its Throne, are (I understand) offended at this innocent paſſage, <hi>p. 37.</hi> of the ſame diſcourſe, <hi>There is a ſtrong tide of report both from Ireland and Scotland, that as far as the intereſt and power, ſo far the inſolency and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hautineſs of that generation we ſpeak of, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in both theſe Nations.</hi> Yet this report (ſo far as it concerneth <hi>Ireland</hi>), hath ſince, by ſober and grave Authors (worthy credit in greater matters then this) who have liv'd for ſeveral years upon the place, and have had (with many others) too much experience of the truth hereof, been confirmed over and over.

But ſo critically and capriciouſly tender are theſe men over their way, that they judge it criminal in thoſe that ſhall call it <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm,</hi> or by any other name then <hi>Anti-pedo-ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm;</hi> by which (it ſeems) Mr <hi>Tombs</hi> hath baptized it, as it were to amuze the common ſort of people, and to put it out of their reach ſo much as to name it amongſt them.

For whereas there are two grand errors, or evils, in this way; the one, an oppoſing the baptizing of children; the other, a ſecond baptizing of thoſe baptized already; the Name, <hi>Anti-pedo-baptiſm,</hi> expreſſeth it only by the former, and ſo is but a kind of half-name to it. Whereas the word <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm,</hi> although it formally ſignifieth only the latter, yet it doth withal <hi>connotare,</hi> or implicitly import the former alſo. For he that perſwadeth to re-baptize at age, conſequently perſwadeth that Baptiſm in Infancy is.
<pb facs="tcp:118706:18"/> or was, a nullity, and ſo a practiſe not warrantable. Therefore <hi>Ana-baptiſm,</hi> of the two, is not only a word of a more eaſie and ready pronunciation, a word by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the long accuſtomed uſe of it in the Baptiſmal controverſies, more paſſable with men, but more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſureably ſignificant alſo of that practiſe or way, which is ſufficiently known amongſt us by this name, and ſuper-ſufficiently otherwiſe. Beſides, though it ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the word <hi>Anabaptiſm,</hi> is not a name or tearm ſo properly at firſt impoſed on their way; yet the uſe and end of names and words, being to convey things from one mans minde and understanding to anothers, the word we ſpeak of, beſt performing this ſervice, in reference to the matter or thing ſignified by it, ought not to be ſtumbled at, or excepted againſt, unleſs men deſire that it ſhould not be underſtood, when their way is ſpoken either for, or againſt. <hi>Loquendum ut vulgus, ſentiendum ut ſapientes,</hi> was an old rule: and I know no ſufficient reaſon why it ſhould be antiquated, or caſhiered: and ſome wiſe men have ſaid, that in civil affairs, <hi>malum benè poſitum non debet moveri.</hi>

               <hi>Fiſhers</hi> own party do inform us. And (doubtleſs) the <hi>narrow and ſtrait way</hi> of which our Saviour ſpeaks, is one and the ſame in, and unto all Nations, and their reſpective Inhabitants. Nor 2. Can this way be termed <hi>ſtrait</hi> or <hi>narrow,</hi> in reſpect of any diſparagement or civil danger, or diſadvantage, that is like to attend it, at leaſt, when and where it is more generally practiſed, as it was in our Saviour, and <hi>John</hi> Baptiſts days: when <hi>Jeruſalem and all Judea, and all the Region round about Jordan,</hi> came unto <hi>John,</hi> and were baptized of him.

<pb facs="tcp:118706:22"/> then <hi>John;</hi> yea <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples themſelves complained unto him, that all men came unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> [meaning to be Baptized.] Leaſt of all can it be attended with any matter of diſhonour or diſ-eſteem, when, or where it is countenanced by the Civil Magiſtrate, and places of honour, truſt, and profit, indifferently, if not more frequently, conferred upon men of this way, as well as upon others; which lately was, and ſtill is (in part) the condition of it in this State and Nation. Conſidering 3. that it cannot be ſaid of Mr <hi>Fiſher</hi>'s way of Baptiſm, that <hi>few there are that find it,</hi> at leaſt if it be ſuppoſed to be the ſame way with that wherein <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> baptized. For we lately heard, that about the time when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpake the words, <hi>Jeruſalem, and all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, and all the Region about Jordan,</hi> with vaſt multitudes beſides, had found the way of their Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing. 4. That neither doth this way <hi>lead unto life,</hi> otherwiſe then in conjunction with, and by the mediation of Faith and Holineſs, <hi>without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord:</hi> and in conjunction with, and by the initiation of theſe, Infant-Baptiſm and Baptiſm without Dipping, will <hi>lead to life,</hi> as well, if not better, then Mr <hi>Fiſher</hi>'s way of Baptizing. Therefore (however) his way is not <hi>the ſtrait and narrow way, which leadeth unto life,</hi> and which ſo <hi>few find.</hi> Beſides, by his aſserting ſuch a principle as this, he adjudgeth the whole <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world ever ſince the days of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Apoſtles; (a very inconſiderable number only excepted) unto the vengeance of eternal fire. For how few of all that love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and bleſsed generation, I mean, of Saints, and holy men, Martyrs, and others, have <hi>found,</hi> entred, or walked in Mr <hi>Fiſher</hi>'s way of Baptizing? But it is no new thing for men, who have a fancy of their own, to lift up to Heaven, to throw down whatſoever ſtandeth in

There were four ſeveral grounds that had good ſeed ſown in them, and three of them bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; but onely one of them yeilded perſeverance. It is the obſervation of an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctor, that <hi>they were ſix hundred thouſand men that came out of Egypt: but there were only two of this vaſt number that entred into the Land of Canaan. So</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall it be in the days of the Meſsiah.</hi> Afterwards, when God ſet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt men on work to cut down and gather this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being now (in all likelyhood) much more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, there were very few eares of the corn that eſcaped them, their vintage afforded few Grapes for the gleaner: their Olive Tree, though full of fruit, being ſhaken, all the berries thereof dropt off to the ground, <hi>two or three</hi> onely excepted <hi>in the top of the uppermost bough, and four or five in the outmoſt fruitful branches</hi> [meaning, that there were very few found amongſt the great ones, &amp; not many amongſt the ordinary or meaner ſort amongſt them, whom God could judge meet to be ſpared in the judgement.] The New Teſtament likewiſe gives frequent notice, that the generality of perſons, who ſhould for a time ingage ſolemnly in a Chriſtian profeſſion, would be like unto the Prophets Fig-Trees
<pb facs="tcp:118706:29"/> with their firſt-ripe Figs: <hi>if they be ſhaken, they will even fall into the mouth ef the Eater.</hi>

You muſt expect to be tempted, and tempted ten times over, to be very violently and reſtleſly haled and importun'd by him, to turn aſide out of, and to exchange that good and ſafe way of God, wherein at preſent you walk, for ſome or other of thoſe crooked and by-paths, which he hath devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and prevailed with ſome <hi>unſtable</hi> and <hi>unlearned,</hi> with ſome proud and ſelf-conceited men, who think they know more then all the world beſides, and that the ſpirit of revelation hath forſaken all fleſh beſides, to inveſt them, to broach and ſet on foot in the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> world. Yea you muſt expect that the Enemy of your peace will knock with Authority, and after the manner of an Angel of light, yea, or of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God himſelf, at the door of your hearts and conſciences, imperiouſly commanding that it be opened unto him, thundering and threatning, like God himſelf, the loſs of ſalvation, the vengeance of eternal fire, if it be not opened unto him. Be therefore (I beſeech you) admoniſhed, and know for a certain, that importunity of an inward ſolicitation is no argument that the perſwaſion, unto which you are ſolicited, cometh from God.<note place="margin">§ 5.</note>

For as the wiſdom of God is <gap reason="foreign">

For as <hi>Livie</hi> reports it to have been the policie of the old <hi>Romans,</hi> to make many other ſhields like unto that, which fell from heaven (as they ſuppoſed) in the days of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> with this Oracle accompanying it, that in what City ſoever that Shield ſhould remain, it ſhould be the moſt flouriſhing and proſperous in the world, that ſo this fatal Shield might not eaſily be diſcerned from the reſt, in caſe any perſon ſhould attempt to ſteal it away: in like manner the Divel knowing that God hath revealed from Heaven, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto the children of men one way of life and ſalvation, he ſets his wits on work to invent and
<pb facs="tcp:118706:31"/> form many other methods and ways of ſome ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with this, that ſo he may amuſe, diſtract, and confound the reaſons, judgements, and conſciences of men (at leaſt of the generality of them) and cauſe them ſtrongly to imagine, that one or other of thoſe ways, which he hath deviſed, and procured a recommendation of, by ſome Pretenders to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or others, unto the world, is that only true and living way, wherein God himſelf hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded men and women to walk, if ever they mean to be ſaved. This is evident in that late Diabolical Sect, commonly known amongſt us by the name of <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſo likewiſe in the Sect of high <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm,</hi> and ſeveral others. And the truth is, that the Truth can by no Artifice or Method be more dangerouſly <hi>reſiſted</hi> or undermined, then by ſetting up counterfeit Tenents and practiſes by it of ſome plauſible ſimilitude, and correſpondencie with it. <hi>Jannes and Jambres</hi> are ſaid to have <hi>withſtood Moſes,</hi> (2 Tim. 3. 8.) becauſe, by ſorcery they wrought falſe miracles, yet like unto thoſe, which <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought by the finger of God. Exod. 7. 11. 22. After the ſame manner (ſaith the Apoſtle) do men <hi>reſiſt the Truth.</hi> Thus becauſe the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was, according to the Scriptures, and the common belief of true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> born of a Virgin, therefore <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus</hi> (the firſt-born of <hi>Sathan,</hi> as one of the Fathers ſtiles him) who affected the honour of being reputed the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> gave out to his followers (as the Eccleſiaſtical hiſtory reporteth) that he alſo was born of a Virgin.</p>

They are like the hollow Trunks or Pipes, which lying between the full fountain or River, and the dry and empty Ciſtern, joyn them together, and ſupply the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyneſs of the one, out of the native fulneſs of the other. God is a fountain full of all grace, goodneſs, light, life, ſtrength, wiſdom, knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And his good pleaſure is to derive and communicate of his fulneſs in all theſe, unto the poor, barren indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent creature, man. But his pleaſure is withall to make this derivation (at leaſt, ordinarily) by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Ordinances and Adminiſtrations, which lye like golden Pipes faſtened in the one end to his own heart and ſoul, and in the other, to the heart and ſoul of man.

Moſt certain it is, that he that hath appointed them for the ſons and daughters of men, hath not appointed them in vain: therefore they who forſake them, ſin againſt, and forſake, their own mercies. The beſt means to preſerve you in honourable and worthy thoughts of them, is to uſe and improve them conſcientiouſly and carefully, and upon every enjoyment of them reſpectively, to take a ſteady account what you have ſpiritually gained by them.

And ſo the Truth it ſelf, though mightily evinced, is by them reſpected under the reproachful notion and name of Error.

This is evident from that of our Saviour to the <hi>Sadduces, (Mat. 22. 31, 32.)

Yet could not the truth be gathered or inferred from the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118706:51"/> ſaid words, but by a diligent, cloſe and intenſe working of the rationative faculty and underſtanding, as is evident. No nor can our Saviours own demonſtration it ſelf (in the place men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So likewiſe he expected that from the example of <hi>David</hi> and his men eating the Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſhould have underſtood and known that it was lawful for men to pluck ears of corn on the Sabbath day, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 23.) yet the argument here was not of ſo ready a perception. The Apoſtle ſaith that God hath exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited faith, or given aſſurance unto all men that he will judg the World in righteouſneſs by the man whom he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained [meaning Chriſt,] <hi>in that he hath raiſed him from the dead, (Acts</hi> 17. 31.) Yet it is a matter of no obvious concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how to conceive or make the act of God in raiſing <hi>Chriſt</hi> from the dead, a ſufficient ground of aſſurance that he will judg the World in righteouſneſs by him.

                        </hi> by ſmiting and ſlaying the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian, who oppreſſed him, he ſuppoſed and expected that <hi>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

His ſuppoſition and expectation in this kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot be judged unreaſonable; nay certainly they were regular and agreeable to the mind of God himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet was this fact of <hi>Moſes</hi> in vindicating the <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> and <hi>ſmiting the Egyptian,</hi> no ſuch pregnant argument at the firſt ſight, no ground of a ready or eaſie conviction unto his Brethren the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that God by his hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to effect that great Deliverance from the Egyptian Bondage, which afterwards (we know) he did effect by him. Nor did his Brethren the Iſraelites, no not ſo much as any one of them (as far as can be gathered from the Scriptures, and as is moſt probable) apprehend or underſtand any ſuch thing thereby.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118706:51"/> And yet this Law was nothing ſo obvious and clear a ground for ſuch a duty and practiſe, as the Command of God for the Circumciſing Children under the Law, is for their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, the Commandment of Baptiſm, or the change of the Ordinance only ſuppoſed, under the Goſpel.</p>

                     <p>If that which in this Conſideration is implicitely denyed (the deferring of Baptiſm to the perſons ſpecified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can, or could be proved from the Scriptures, the proof muſt be, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther firſt, by ſome example of an Infant, one or more, of the relation mentioned, who was not baptized untill mans eſtate. But evident it is that no ſuch proof as this can be found in the Scriptures. Or elſe 2. the ſaid proof muſt be made, by producing ſome prohibition of Divine Authority, by which Beleeving Parents are reſtrained, from deſiring Baptiſme for their children, untill maturity of years. But as certain it is that no proof in this kind neither, can be found in the Scriptures. Or 3. and laſtly, the proof we ſpeak of muſt be made by producing ſome reaſon, or ground other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, from the Scriptures, by which the neceſſity of ſuch a Dilation is ſubſtantially evinced. But neither do the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures afford any proof of the point in queſtion, in this kind, as our Adverſaries themſelves, upon the matter, as far as I underſtand, do confeſſe, in that they never yet produced any. If it be objected and ſaid; though there be no particular or ſpecial prohibition in the Scriptures reſtraining <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from deſiring Baptiſme for their children, whileſt they are yet children, yet are their prohibitions in general laid as well upon them, as others, to reſtrain them from will-worſhip, and ſo from uſing the Holy things of God, in any manner not directed or preſcribed by himſelf: and conſequently, to reſtrain Beleeving Parents from offering their children,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118706:69"/> whileſt ſuch, unto Baptiſme, in as much as Infant-Baptiſme is will-worſhip, or an act or kind of worſhip not preſcribed by him? to this I anſwer.</p>
                     <p>That every uſage of the Holy things of God, after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner not particularly preſcribed by him, is not will-worſhip. To read a Chapter, two or three daily, is no will-worſhip; yet is it an uſing of the Holy Scriptures, nor particularly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by God. To give the Holy things of God in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Supper unto women, is an uſage of theſe Holy things not particularly directed or preſcribed by God himſelf, yet it is far from Will-worſhip. To pray about a quarter, or half, or an whole hour every day, is an uſage of the Holy Ordnance of prayer not particularly preſcribed by God, yet is it not Will-worſhip: many inſtances in this kind might be added. Therefore neither is the Baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants any ſtrein of Will-worſhip upon any ſuch account as this, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it is an uſage of an Ordinance not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly preſcribed by God.</p>
                     <p>2. Will-worſhip properly conſiſts in this, when men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit or perform that in the name of worſhip, or for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, unto God, which he hath not preſcribed as any part of his worſhip. As they who conceit they worſhip God by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized men and women, having formerly been bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed infants, do moſt properly commit the ſin of Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, becauſe it is certain that God hath not preſcribed any ſuch things, eſpecially not in the nature of worſhip. Yea it is a kind of Will-worſhip, if Parents-place worſhip in offering their children unto Baptiſm, becauſe God doth not require this of them in the nature of worſhip, but of obedience and duty otherwiſe. All duty is not worſhip: neither is every act not warrantable by the Scriptures, though ſuppoſed ſuch, an act of Will-worſhip.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) it hath been proved by many arguments and grounds, both in this diſcourſe and in ſeveral others by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, that the mind and will of God is, that <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Parents ſhould devote and conſecrate their children by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, unto his ſervice, upon the firſt opportunity from the beginning of their daies.

However, evident it is in the mean time, that no <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Parent is reſtrained, by any prohibition in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whether general or ſpecial, againſt will Worſhip, from deſiring Baptiſm for his infant, whileſt ſuch.</p>

                     <p>The former part of this conſideration is unqueſtionable, That Infants were Members of the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in by our Adverſaries with both hands: otherwiſe it is ready of proof, and hath been ſubſtantially proved by others. <note n="a" place="margin">M.

For what Communion was there between Infant-church-memberſhip, and a <hi>Levitical</hi> cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, more then between ſuch a ceremony as this, and the Church-memberſhip of men? Or was there ſome myſtical or ſpiritual thing ſignified by the former, and none ſignified by the latter? Or was the former appointed, or ordained by God amongſt the <hi>Levitical</hi> obſervations, or rites, more then the latter? Or was the former Church-member-ſhip ſome part of the worſhip or ſervice of God, and the latter none? Doubtleſſe none of theſe things can be affirmed, but with a brow, either of Lead, or Braſs. If then the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberſhip of Infants was no <hi>Levitical,</hi> no legal ceremony, by whom ſhall we judge it hath been aboliſhed? We cannot either with reaſon, or with truth, judge it to be aboliſhed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſince it was no part of the <hi>hand-writing of Ordinances
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118706:70"/> that was againſt us, and contrary to us;</hi> which is that, which <hi>he took out of the way nailing it to his Croſs, Col.</hi> 2. 14 If it hath not been aboliſhed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it muſt needs be <hi>Sathan</hi> who ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly attempteth the abolition of it. Would the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> have taken little children up into his arms, laid his hands on them, and bleſſed them, if his heart had been ſet with-in him to caſt them out of his Church? Impoſition of hands is no ceremony of excommunication, or caſting out of the Church: nay it is practiſed at this day by many Anabaptiſts in their Churches, as a ceremony of receiving into the Church.</p>
                     <p>To ſay that the whole policy and frame of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church is now diſſolved and taken away, and ſo Infant-Church-memberſhip is ceaſed with it, is to ſay ſomewhat, but nothing to the purpoſe. For by this reaſon, as well men-Church-memberſhip, as Infant-Church-memberſhip, ſhould be ceaſed, in as much as both were alike diſſolved and taken away in the deſolation of the Jewiſh Church and Nation. Secondly the diſſolution or taking away of the policy or frame of a particular Church, in a way of judgement or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for ſin (which was, and is, the caſe of the deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and Nation) proveth not that the <hi>ſpecies</hi> or kind of policy, according to which this Church was conſtituted and framed, is hereby declared unlawfull, either to be introduced, or continued, by other Churches. For by this reaſon it ſhould not be lawfull for <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches in theſe daies, to admit of that Church-conſtitution and frame, according to which the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> were conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, theſe, with their Church conſtitution, being long ſince ruin'd and laid waſt.</p>
                     <p>If it be here replied; But the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church-conſtitution, ſhould, and would, have been diſſolved by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and quite aboliſhed out of the world, although the Members of this Church had not provoked God by ſin, either to diſſolve it, or to deſtroy their Nation; and conſequently no part or piece of this conſtitution ought to be admitted or entertained under the Goſpel, upon the account of the former eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it under the Law, I anſwer;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By conceſſion, That that which was <hi>Moſaical,</hi> and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional and accidental, in the conſtitution and frame of this
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118706:71"/> Church, would (doubtleſſe) have been aboliſhed, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whether the Nation had provoked him to its own ruine and deſtruction, or no. But</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By way of exception, I anſwer further that the <hi>Jews</hi> were a Church not onely before the daies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and before the ſetting up of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Prieſthood among them, but even before Circumciſion it ſelf; and conſequently were under ſome Church-conſtitution, or other: Now it cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, nor is it in it ſelf probable in the leaſt, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his comming did aboliſh this original conſtitution or frame of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, in any part or branch of it. Somewhat (indeed) of this fundamental Conſtitution was, for the eaſe and benefit of the Church, altered by God, when the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical</hi> and <hi>Levitical</hi> additions were made to it, according to what we find, <hi>Numb. 3, 12. And I, behold I have taken the Levites from among the children of Iſrael, inſtead of all the firſt born that openeth the Matrice among the children of Iſrael: therefore the Levites ſhall be mine.</hi> Under the firſt conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church we ſpeak of, the firſt born male in every family executed the Office of Prieſt (as Mr. <hi>Ainsworth</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth from, and noteth on, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 5.) This in the ſuper-additions of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Oeconomy was altered; the firſt born in all the other tribes being diſcharged from this ſervice, and an intire tribe (<hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Levi</hi>) ſubſtituted in their ſtead. But whatſoever of that primitive conſtitution of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, was not changed by the Miniſtry or Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> neither have we any competent ground to judge that it was changed, or taken away by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now then Infant-Church-memberſhip being a ſpecial branch of the fundamental conſtitution of the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and not being altered or changed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor having any thing typical or ſignificative in it, but conſtantly practiſed under him, and during his <hi>Oeconomy,</hi> it is a groundleſſe conceit to think it was changed by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> No marvell if circumciſion were changed and taken away by him, conſidering that it was a ſuper-added ceremony to that original conſtitution mentioned, and ſo of the ſame nature and conſideration with the Moſaical Rites and Ordinances.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And laſtly, ſuppoſe the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> had not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118706:71"/> provoked God by their unbelief, and rejection of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> but had received him, and beleeved on him, as a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant did, though their <hi>Moſaical</hi> Church-conſtitution ſhould have been diſſolved, and had ceaſed, yet they ſhould have paſſed from under this conſtitution, into that which is now ordained for <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches. And what? is it ſo much as tolerable to imagine, that coming hither, they ſhould have left their children behind them? eſpecially conſidering that they had injoyed this great conſolatory priviledge of having their children fellow-members with them, in the Church of God, even from before the dayes of their Father <hi>Abraham.</hi> And if they had been informed, or had apprehended, that in caſe they ſhould beleeve, themſelves (indeed) ſhould be numbred amongſt the people of God, and be received as members into his Church, but they muſt expect no ſuch thing for their children, theſe muſt remain in the condition of aliens and ſtrangers, notwithſtanding their (the Parents) beleeving, would not this have been a ſore ſtumbling block in their way, and grand diſſuaſive and diſcouragement unto them from beleeving; eſpecially conſidering (as was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved from <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 21.) how mightily the hearts, even of thoſe, who had begun to beleeve, was ſet upon the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſing of their children, and how highly they were offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon an information, that <hi>Paul</hi> taught the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were among the Gentiles, not to circumciſe their children? If it were ſo great a grievance and offence to the beleeving <hi>Jews,</hi> that circumciſion ſhould be denied unto their children, how irreconcilable may we reaſonably think, the ſpirits of the reſt of them muſt needs have been with <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, in caſe they had underſtood that according to the principles hereof, their children muſt neither be circumciſed, no nor yer baptized; nor have any Character or badge of any rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto God, more then the children of Heathen Idolaters, or of thoſe Nations that knew not God. That we hear of no murmuring or complaining in all the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, from any <hi>Jew</hi> againſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or their Religion, about the non-baptizing of their children, whereas we do hear of complaint made by them, for their oppoſing the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſing of their children, it is an argument to me of a like
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118706:72"/> unqueſtionable proof, that children in the times of the New Teſtament were as ordinarily baptized, as they were kept from being circumciſed.</p>

The reaſon is, becauſe he that is baptiſmally dipt, dippeth a good part of his body him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by going into the water, and by ſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there up to the knees, middle, or neck, before the Baptiſt layeth hand on him.

He that properly dippeth, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity hold ſome part of that which is dipped in his hand, or with ſome inſtrument in his hand. Therefore he that is bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by dipping, cannot be reaſonably thought to be regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baptized, unleſſe he be with clean ſtrength heaved and lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up into the air by the Baptiſt, and ſo gently let down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water, the hand of the Baptizer not taken off from him all the while.</p>

                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:118706:79"/>
                     <p>Yea, own we the two Engliſh tranſlations of both the clauſes now under conſideration, yet can there no convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing argument be drawn from them, either <hi>diviſim,</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctim,</hi> to prove that <hi>Philip</hi> dipped the <hi>Eunuch</hi> when he baptized him. For ſuppoſing the water to have been very ſhallow (for the proof whereof more, I beleeve hath been ſaid, then ever will be to prove the contrary) and the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt part of it to have been ſomewhat lower then the level or ſurface of the verge or bank about it (which is not unuſual in many waters) there might be ſome neceſſity, or at leaſt a convenience, as well for <hi>Philip,</hi> as for the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> to go down together <hi>into</hi> the water, that ſo the former might take up water with his hand to put, or pour, upon the head or face, of the other.</p>
                     <p>Beſides it is as well ſaid of <hi>Philip,</hi> as of the Eunuch, that he both went down into the water, and came up from, or out of, the water. But no man (I preſume) imagineth that <hi>Philip</hi> at this turn dipped himſelf. Therefore from the ſaid phraſes or expreſſions, nothing can be concluded for the dipping of the other; both expreſſions being indifferently uſed of, and applied unto, both theſe perſons.</p>
                     <p>Again, if the Eunuch went down into the water, he could not be dipped all over by <hi>Philip,</hi> and conſequently could not regularly be baptized, if it he ſuppoſed. 1. That a regular baptizing conſiſteth in a total ſubmerſion, or dipping of the whole body under water: And 2. That it is wholly to be tranſacted or performed by another. For he that goeth into the water dippeth himſelf in part: neither can another be ſaid to dip him all over, except he firſt heaves, or lifteth him up out of, and above the water; and then, ſtill holding his body in, or between his hands, gently convey, or let it down, into the water again.</p>
                     <p>To pretend, that the Eunuch might have been duly bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, without going down into the water, and without <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi> going down likewiſe, if Baptiſme could have been duly adminiſtred, either by ſprinkling, or by putting a ſmall quantity of water, upon his head, or face; as <hi>viz.</hi> by ſending a ſervant to the Fountain, to fetch a Baſon, or like veſſel of water from thence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to pretend thus (I ſay) amounts to little ſatisfaction. For,</p>

                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:118706:80"/>1. It cannot be proved that either a baſon, or like veſſel was now at hand; Baſons are not uſually carried about in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, eſpecially not in long journies.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Suppoſe there had been the opportunity of a Baſon, or the like, yet might there be ſeveral reaſons (though unknown to us) why <hi>Philip,</hi> being at liberty, whether to baptize, at, or in, the Fountain, or otherwiſe, might prefer the former. So that there is nothing in the pretence ſpecified, nor in any thing expreſſed or recorded in the Scriptures, about the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs baptizing, which makes it ſo much as probable, much leſſe demonſtrable, or certain, that he was dipped under water, when baptized.</p>
                     <p>Nor is there any whit more in <hi>John's</hi> baptizing in <hi>Jordan,</hi> or in <hi>Aenon</hi> near <hi>Sali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>, becauſe much water</hi> was here (<hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 23.) to prove that <hi>John</hi> dipped when he baptized. For</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is nothing recorded by the Holy Ghoſt touching the particular external manner, according to which <hi>John</hi> baptized. Which (by the way) is an argument of much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction unto me, that no one determinate external manner in baptizing, or of managing, ordering, or uſing the water in Baptiſm, is eſſential unto the Ordinance, or the due admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration thereof. For it is the firſt-born of things incredible unto me, that God ſhould preſcribe unto men ſo great and weighty an Ordinance, as Baptiſm (more generally at leaſt) is conceived to be, yea and which our Adverſaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of late to ſay, is abſolutely neceſſary unto juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (and conſequently unto ſalvation it ſelf) and yet not ſignifie or declare, and this in the moſt plain, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit and diſtinct manner, how this Ordinance ought to be adminiſtred, in caſe it be ſuppoſed that there is onely one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate manner of the adminiſtration, which is regular and legitimate; yea and which is ſo eſſential unto it, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it nothing but a meer nullity, or humane device, can be adminiſtred; eſpecially this determinate manner being ſuch, which the cleareſt and ſharpeſt underſtanding of men of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt worth in the Church of Chriſt, and moſt diligently and conſcienouſly exerciſed in the Scriptures, have not been able for many generations together, to diſcern or diſcover.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Neither is there the leaſt intimation any where given
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:118706:80"/> in the Scripture, that the reaſon why <hi>John</hi> made his firſt choice of the River <hi>Jordan</hi> for his Baptiſmal ſtation, or reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or his ſecond of <hi>Aenon</hi> (where much water, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many waters, was,) that he might have water enough to dip all thoſe, that came to be baptized of him, over head and ears. Therefore this is but a matter of humane conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture onely, and this not very probable neither. For 1. It is not like that a reaſon of this conſequence would have been left to humane divination, being ſo worthy of God's own pen, were it, or had it had been, a truth. 2. Though it be ſaid that in <hi>Aenon,</hi> where <hi>John</hi> laſt baptized, there were <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Some who have travelled in thoſe parts, report this <hi>Aenon</hi> to be a little run or brook, over which a man may almoſt ſtep at ordinary times. 3. If <hi>John</hi> dipped, when he baptized, either in <hi>Jordan</hi> or in <hi>Aenon,</hi> he muſt be ſuppoſed to have dipped both men and women, either naked, or in their cloaths. In ſome Authors (I confeſſe) I meet with both ſexes naked in their baptizing: but the greateſt part of writers judge it more <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and meet to allow them their apparel for a covering to their nakedneſſe at ſuch a time. And if it could be proved that <hi>John</hi> baptized both men and women, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and both in the preſence and ſight of either<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the very retriment and dreggs of all ſects at this day amongſt us (the Ranters I mean) might take a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible occaſion to glory in a very honourable Father and Founder of their Order. Nor can it reaſonably be thought that <hi>John</hi> ſhould baptize all that came unto him, with their garments upon them, in caſe it be ſuppoſed that he dipped them all under water, when he baptized them.</p>
                     <p>For we do not read of any ſpare garments brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them, by thoſe who came to be baptized (nor yet of any ſhifting or changing garments, either before, or after baptizing) nor is ſuch a thing in it ſelf in any degree proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and yet more improbable it is (of the two) that men and women, how weak and tender ſoever, ſhould travel ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral miles in their cloaths ſoaked and ſteeped, and as wet as water could lightly make them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It appoſeth my reaſon, yea and imagination it ſelf, to conceive how ſo many thouſands, ſuch vaſt multitudes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as the Sciptures overtureth had recourſe unto <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If <hi>Andrew</hi> reaſonably judged 5 Barley loaves and 2 ſmall fiſhes ſo inſufficient &amp; diſproportionable a proviſion for 5000 men, as to demand, <hi>but what are theſe among ſo many?</hi> much more have we reaſon to demand concerning <hi>John,</hi> what was <hi>John</hi> among ſo many thouſands of men and women as came unto him to be baptized, if he could not baptize them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:118706:81"/> dipping them? Upon this ſuppoſition, the task which he performed in baptizing, required the ſtrength not of a man, but of ſtones, or of Mountains, to overcome it. Beſides muſt he not be ſuppoſed to have ſtood deep in water, from morning untill night, for ſeveral days together? which that he did, or was able to do, and yet live, I muſt borrow the Faith of ſome eaſie Beleever, to beleeve. Other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there are (too many to be inſiſted upon at preſent) which make it an invinceible difficulty to my Faith, to beleeve that <hi>John</hi> put under water the whole bodies of all thoſe whom he baptized. That may be remembred by the way, that neither do we read, that <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples ever baptized, though the Diſciples of the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> did; nor that <hi>John,</hi> in or about his entrance upon his work of baptizing, when it ſeems his labour in this imployment lay heavieſt upon him, had any Diſciples (in that notion and relation of which we now ſpeak) at all. Nor is this latter in it ſelf ſo much as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. 5. And laſtly, we read <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 22. that the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> continued ſome ſpace of time baptizing in <hi>Judea.</hi> Now if we may beleeve the Geographical deſcriptions of this land, which are preſented unto us from ſeveral hands, there were few or no rivers or waters in it of any conſiderable depth, but onely brooks, or ſmaller rivers: Therefore it is not like (much leſſe certain) that the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt</hi> here had the opportunity of dipping men, when they baptized them; much leſſe that they made the Adminiſtration by dipping. Thus we ſee how weak and faint the conjecture is, which preſumeth, that the reaſon why <hi>John</hi> made choice firſt of the River of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and then of <hi>Aenon,</hi> where <hi>many waters</hi> are ſaid to have been, for his Baptiſmal ſtation, was, that he might have a convenience of deep waters, for the dipping of thoſe, who came to be baptized.</p>

So that the reaſon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd why <hi>John</hi> was drawn to baptize in <hi>Aenon,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>many waters</hi> there, and ſo why he baptized in <hi>Jordan, (viz.</hi> that he might have ſufficient dippage) is a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, yea improbable conjecture. But</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And laſtly for this, the reaſons of greateſt probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (in my underſtanding) why <hi>John</hi> choſe to baptize, where plenty of water was, were theſe two (haply amongſt others) the one reſpecting the commodiouſneſſe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal work or act it ſelf, of baptizing; the other, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate the ſpiritual deſign, or purpoſe of God in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, It may well be preſumed, that before <hi>John</hi> entred upon the work of Baptizing, it was made known to him by God (or otherwiſe, that he apprehended the thing very likely to come to paſſe) that vaſt multitudes of people from ſeveral parts would from day to day have recourſe unto him to be baptized. In this reſpect it concerned him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and find out the beſt method and means he could, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate himſelf in ſo great a work, as well in point of eaſe, as of expedition or diſpatch. Now the work of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing being to be performed with, or by, water, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers very great of perſons to be baptized by him, it was very

In ſuch a way as this, where there are tracts of water com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, for any conſiderable ſpace together, for people ſo to ſtand, whether in the brink or verge of the water, or elſe near to it, that a perſon going along by them in the water, may caſt water upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many thouſands may be baptized within the compaſſe of a day, or leſſe: Whereas to dip e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very perſon apart, when there are ſeveral thouſands to be baptized, and but one to baptize, is (in the ordinary phraſe) an endleſſe work.</p>

To argue, that ſprinkling with water, is not a <hi>baptizing,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a <hi>rantizing,</hi> is ſuch a kind of reaſoning as this: <hi>Socrates</hi> cannot be a living creature becauſe he is a man: <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephalus</hi> is not a beaſt, becauſe he is an horſe. Theſe are ſtrange kinds of arguings wherein the <hi>genus</hi> is denied, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or becauſe the <hi>ſpecies</hi> is affirmed The Sacramental rite or Ordinance, beſt known by the name of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> is therefore in the Scriptures ordinarily thus called, I mean <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the adminiſtration of it, a <hi>Baptizing,</hi> becauſe it is a generical term, and more comprehenſive, then <hi>rantizing,</hi> or, <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> and importeth as hath been ſhewed, any kind of waſhing, whether by ſprinkling, or by pouring on water, or by applying water to the thing, or perſon to be waſhed, after any other manner. And waſhing being that externality which was chiefly minded by God, in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Baptiſm, it is not material by, or with, what <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or particular kind of waſhing it be performed. And <hi>Calvin</hi> accordingly, though his opinion be, that at firſt it was adminiſtred with the ſubmerſion of the whole body under water, yet placeth little in this modality of it, and ſuppoſeth the adminiſtration of it in another manner [as ſuppoſe by

This for the firſt reaſon why <hi>John</hi> made choice of ſuch places for his Baptiſmal quarters, where plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of water was to be found: Herein he conſulted expedition and diſpatch in his work of baptizing.</p>
                     <p>The latter reaſon of ſuch his choice might reſpect (as we ſaid) the ſpiritual and great end of Baptiſm, which was, and is, to ſet forth, commend, and confirm the abundant Grace of God in cleanſing men as well from the ſtain and filth, as from the guilt of ſin, by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now this grace of God being Sacramentally ſignified or repreſented by the element of water in Baptiſm; the ſight or beholding of a fair and large proſpect of this element at the time of their baptizing, might occaſion or raiſe, ſo much the greater, and more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehenſions within them of the great aboundance of this grace of his towards them.</p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:118706:83"/>
                     <p>Whether theſe, either one or both, be the true reaſons, or no, of <hi>John's</hi> pitching his Baptiſmal Tent, ſo near unto rivers or currents of water; moſt certain it is, that both the one, and the other, are of a more reaſonable and probable calculation, then that which maketh conveniency of dipping the ground hereof. This is a dull and ſpiritleſſe conceit, as hath been ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>And thus we have given a large and full account of truth in the former part of the Conſideration laſt propounded, which affirmeth, that it cannot be proved from the Scriptures, that any Baptiſmal Adminiſtration recorded here, was performed by dipping. For I know nothing pleaded by any man to prove the contrary, beyond what hath been now anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall not need to inſiſt upon any proof of the latter part of the Conſideration, which onely beareth, that <hi>it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding probable that many of the ſaid Adminiſtrations were performed without dipping.</hi> For if ſo be, there be ſo little probability, as hath been argued, that ſo much as any one of theſe Adminiſtrations were performed by dipping; there muſt needs be a like (or rather a far greater) degree of probability, that ſome of them (at leaſt) have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without. More eſpecially where we read of great multitudes or of ſeveral thouſands, baptized together, or at one and the ſame time, it is hardly reconcilable with the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt terms of probability, to imagine that they were all dipt. And thoſe arguments and reaſons, by which the dipping of the Jaylour and his houſe, when they were baptized, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to be ſalved, are not worthy reaſonable or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering men.

If this alſo be ſuppoſed, it muſt yet further be ſuppoſed likewiſe, that they were dipped, either naked,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:118706:84"/> or with their garments on them. The former of theſe is an hard ſuppoſition, and will not (I ſuppoſe) down with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber men. If the latter be ſuppoſed, it muſt be ſuppoſed yet again that either they ſhifted themſelves out of their wet garments into drie, before they ſpread a Table, and ſet meat before <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas;</hi> or elſe that they performed this Chriſtian ſervice with their garments full of water, and drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. To ſuppoſe this latter, requires zeal without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: to ſuppoſe the former, requires the faith of thoſe that can beleeve what they pleaſe, without asking any queſtion for conſcience ſake. For the context will hardly allow them ſo much time between their being baptized, and the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this ſervice, as was neceſſary for their ſhifting. However, we clearly ſee what a long ſtory of uncertainties yea of improbabilities, muſt be compiled, and beleeved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can reaſonably come to beleeve that the Jaylor, and all his, were dipped, when baptized. Nor is it eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive where ſo much water ſhould be in or about <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> which might ſuffice for the baptizing of 3000 perſons within the ſpace of about half a day (probably in a leſſer time) if this be a true ſaying, no dipping, no baptizing. How ſlender and faint the appearance of truth is in that Doctrine, which teacheth the dipping of the <hi>Eunuch</hi> by <hi>Philip,</hi> when he bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized him, was lately under conſideration. The amount of the whole is, that it is by many degrees more probable, that no Baptiſmal Adminiſtration mentioned in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was performed with dipping, then that all the ſaid Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations here recorded were performed after ſuch a manner.</p>

This to be the Goſpel rule for the regulation of the time of baptizing, is ſo evident from many expreſſe and clear paſſages of the Goſpel it ſelf, that it is, (I preſume) owned in this capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſubſcribed, by Ana-Baptiſts themſelves: Or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is abundantly evinced by others to be ſuch. <note n="a" place="margin">

                        </note> Now that that practice of baptizing, which the Conſideration ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifieth, is utterly inconſiſtent with this rule, is above all reaſonable contradiction made good by this argument, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it cannot ordinarily be known, or however, is not ordinarily known, when, or at what time, the children of Beleevers are firſt made Diſciples, unleſſe that they will grant that they are Diſciples from the womb; which will altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as much, and as manifeſtly, endamage their cauſe. That the children we ſpeak of do ordinarily profeſſe a beleeving in God, and ſo in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> long before they come to any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultneſſe of years, many of them at 3, 4, or 5 years of age, yea and ſome ſooner, is generally known to us; but when, or at what time a principle of Grace, or Faith, is firſt wrought in them, is altogether as unknown.

                     <p>It were endleſſe to recite all that which approved Authors and of unqueſtionable credit, have recorded concerning the moſt abſurd, horrid, and blaſphemous Doctrites and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which in all forreign parts, where that generation of men we ſpeak of, have had to do, have been held, maintained, and importunely propagated by them. It is wel known that the graveſt and moſt judicious writers ſince the late reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>Calvin, Bucer, Zanchy, P.

                     <p>But it may be our <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſoil is more proper for the way, and breeds a more compoſed and better-headed kind of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſt, leſſe obnoxious to fumes and fancies, to ſtrange notions and erroneous conceits, then other countries, or that God intreateth the Anabaptiſts amongſt us more graciouſly, then to deliver them up to ſuch enormous and vile opinions, as thoſe found amongſt perſons of the ſame denomination, in other places of the world. The truth is, that <hi>Nec lacte lacti, nec ovum ovo ſimilius,</hi> milk is not more like unto milk, nor one egg to another. Whether this be true, or no I am content ſhall be adjudged by the Native reſult and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, ariſing from thoſe unqueſtionable premiſes, which are delivered and aſſerted by Mr. <hi>Ri.

And how few did you ever know that entred this dore, but they went yet further, except they died, or repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhortly after. I confeſſe that of the multitudes of Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts that I have known, at the preſent I cannot call to mind any one, that hath ſtopt there, &amp;c.</hi> Afterwards he ſubjoins ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances for the proof of theſe things, from the very books and writings of ſeveral perſons, after they had been initiated in the myſteries of Anabaptiſm. If I judged it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, I could out of mine own knowledge, furniſh his ſtage with more Actors, and name ſome others, men of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown amongſt the Profeſſors of the Anabaptiſmal Faith, whoſe judgements ſince their bowing down to take up Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm, have been ridden by many other corrupt and noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome opinions, unto which they are in bondage to this day.</p>
                     <p>So that it is a thing too evident and manifeſt to be denied, that God hath from time to time witneſſed, and doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:118706:91"/> at this day, againſt the Doctrine and practiſe of Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, by delivering up thoſe who entertain them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſpirits of error and deluſion. The equitableneſs of which judgement on Gods part, may be conſidered in this, that it is a righteous and juſt thing with him, to leave thoſe, through want of wiſdom and man-like underſtanding to depart from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the truth, who will not ſuffer children to come unto him, when he calleth for them.</p>
                     <p>Concerning thoſe two other kinds of Divine Teſtimonies, whereby God hath witneſſed againſt the way of Anabaptiſm, (yea and doth witneſſe) as well in forreign parts, as in our own land; the one, by delivering up thoſe that will not be reclaimed from it in time, unto ſhamefull, hatefull, and vile practices and waies; the other, unto ruinating jugdements, in one kind or other, I ſhall not burthen the Readers patience with any long diſcourſe; partly becauſe theſe two latter judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or teſtimonies from God, muſt needs follow of courſe the former; (erroneous and vile opinions naturally iſſuing foul and vicious practiſes; and theſe again calling for ruine and deſtruction from the righteous God) partly alſo becauſe various and large ſtories may be read in many Authentique Authours for the confirmation of the truth as touching both.</p>

                     <p>This Conſideration is greater in evidence then exception, or doubt, even without proof. For that Baptiſm is a typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ordinance, and according to the counſel and intention of the great father and founder of it, given in ſubſervience to ends and purpoſes of higher conſequence then it ſelf, is (I
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:118706:98"/> ſuppoſe) the ſence and joint conſent of thoſe, who diſturb the peace of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world about it. Or however, the thing is fully evident from that known deſcription of it in the Goſpel, wherein it is termed the <hi>Baptiſme of Repentance for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> (of which more largely in the latter part of this diſcourſe.) Now all typical Ordinances are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed or preſcribed, and given by God unto men, either 1. For the teaching and inſtructing them in ſomething that is more ſpiritual and ſecret, or 2. For the confirming and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing them, touching, either the certainty and truth of things already paſt, or the injoyment of good things, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the promiſe of God yet to come; or 3. For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minding them of ſomething that is abſent: or 4. (And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) for the ingaging them to ſome future action, kind, or courſe, of acting. There may poſſibly be other ends of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical inſtitutions, beſides theſe: but theſe onely at preſent come to mind. However, when the end, or ends, for which any ſuch Ordinance, as thoſe of which we now ſpeak, was appointed, be once obtained and injoied by men (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the uſe of this Ordinance, or without it; for God is at liberty to work his good pleaſure in men, and for men, without any Ordinance, though men be not left at liberty to <hi>omit</hi> them in their reſpective ſeaſons, nor to neglect or deſpiſe them at any time) the uſe, or further uſe of ſuch an Ordinance, is not required by God: nor can it in the uſe of it, be of any conſequence, benefit, or concernment unto men. Now concerning Baptiſm, let the ends of it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, what men reaſonably can ſuppoſe or imagine them to be, they are all obtained and enjoyed by many, by means of that Baptiſm, or Conſecration unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> by Water, which was adminiſtred unto them in their infancy, and which they ſtil own, and in the ſtrength and conſcience whereof they ſtill walk, without any other Baptiſm received by them afterwards; as I have fully demonſtrated, <hi>pag</hi> 24, 25, 26, 27. of my Diſcourſe, intituled, <hi>Water-dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, &amp;c.</hi>

But as the great Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> though circumciſed himſelf according to the Law of God, yea and upon occaſion, an Adminiſtrer of it unto others, yet ſeverely rebuked, yea and wiſhed the cutting off of thoſe, that ſtickled for the practiſe of it by <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> becauſe of the great diſturbance occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hereby in the Churches of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Yea and threatned thoſe with no leſſe then loſſe of Salvation by Chriſt, who ſhould ſubmit to it upon the terms, on which it was impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely commended, and obtrued upon them by thoſe who taught it: So if he were now alive amongſt us, there needs be little queſtion but that he would walk in the ſame ſteps of Apoſtolical ſeverity againſt thoſe, who are importune and reſtleſſe in unſetling the minds, and troubling the Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the people of God, in kindling fires of contention and ſtrife, and making breaches and diviſions in Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, by their vehement urging and preſſing their new, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and inſnaring Doctrines about the adequate ſubject, the preciſe mode or manner of the Adminiſtration of <hi>Baptiſm,

For the reaſon why the Apoſtle fell ſo heavy upon the fierce Advocates of circumciſion, was not for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſions ſake, as if he bare any peculiar hatred againſt this; or becauſe it was now an obſolete ceremony, and as good as out of date; we do not find any ſuch reaſon as this of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in that kind, ſo much as whiſpered, but becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an external rite and ceremony, they ſought to enthrall the judgements and conſciences of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to the practiſe of it, as if they could not have been juſtified or ſaved without it.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:118706:102"/> their notion; which they ſhould obtrude upon the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world in this caſe, and upon theſe terms, ſhould prove to be the truth. The mind and will of God was, that by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and ſuffering of Chriſt in the fleſh, the <hi>Moſaical</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of meats ſhould ceaſe, and that Beleevers ſhould be at liberty, (and ſo judge themſelves) to eat what kind of meats they pleaſed. Yet was it expreſſely contrary to the Will of God, that they who knew the truth and will of God in this caſe, ſhould be either troubleſome, or inſnaring unto other <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſo much as by the exerciſe or acting of this their liberty before them. <hi>Haſt thou Faith [i. e.</hi> beleeveſt thou, that thou now lawfully mayeſt eat meats, that were prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law!] <hi>have it to thy ſelf before God; a</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">a <hi>Rom. 14. 22</hi>

Whereas the knowledge of the mind of God touching the proper ſubject of the Baptiſmal Adminiſtration, eſpecially if it be that, which Mr. <hi>A.</hi> and his party contend for, is by this (to omit many other arguments) evicted to be of very ſlender conſequence, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſince, and where, it hath been diſcovered, and a practiſe correſponding with it ſubmitted unto, the State of Chriſtianity hath little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced (if not retreated rather) nor any thing more of God, or of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> been ſeen or known in the world, then was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

For they do not hold or teach, that <hi>an Adminiſtrator of Boptiſm made to infants,</hi> is more <hi>agreeable to the mind of God,</hi> then a like adminiſtration made to ſome, who beleeve, and profeſſe the beleef of the Goſpel.

Neither do they hold (at leaſt ſome of them) but that Baptiſm may be adminiſtred to thoſe who have lived looſely and prophanely in a profeſſion of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, upon their repentance, at leaſt in caſe they have not been baptized formerly, and this with as much <hi>agreeableneſſe</hi> alſo to the mind of God, as unto Infants. Nay 3 ſome of them (for I know not the ſence of them all in this point) are not poſitive, but that the ſaid adminiſtration may be made, and this with as much agreeableneſſe unto the mind of God as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to infants, to ſuch Beleevers, though formerly baptized, whoſe conſciences cannot be ſatisfied without it; according to the ſaying of the Apoſtle in a like caſe, <hi>It is better to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then burn;</hi> though if the <hi>burning</hi> could be healed without <hi>marrying,</hi> it were <hi>better</hi> then either. But that which they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally hold in the Queſtion about the ſubject of Baptiſmal adminiſtration, is, that this adminiſtration may with good agreeableneſſe to the mind of God, be made unto infants.

               <p>In order to the advance of his firſt argument, he preſcribes us the <hi>beſt way</hi> (as <hi>he conceives</hi>) to come to ſatisfaction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſaid Queſtion, and this (ſaith he) is to <hi>obſerve the</hi>

                  <hi>footſteps of the Flock of Chriſt in the firſt ſetting forth of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, &amp;c.</hi> (he means, in the practiſe of Chriſtians, in <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſts, and Apoſtles times.) To prove this to be the beſt way, he refers us to what the Apoſtle did in one caſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, 23. and to what <hi>Chriſt</hi> did in another, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 4. 8. But firſt Mr. <hi>A.</hi> preſcribes us one way to come to the ſaid ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, but his Proofs and Texts brought to commend this way unto us, lead us to another way. This way which his proofs and texts lead us, unto is (indeed) abſolute and compleat, and could he guide our feet into this way, in the caſe and queſtion in hand, we ſhould without asking, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any more queſtions for conſcience ſake, walk together with him in it. But this way conſiſteth not in the footſteps of the flock of Chriſt, nor in the practiſe or example (one, or more) no not of the greateſt Saints, but in the expreſſe letter of an inſtitution. In the latter of the two places cited, our Saviour, for the reducing of marriage, and matters relating thereunto, to their primitive intent and uſe, doth not ſend the Jews to the practiſe either of <hi>Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> or any of them that came neareſt in practiſe to the Law, or inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of marriage, but to the inſtitution it ſelf. So likewiſe in the former, the Apoſtle, to make ſtreight, what the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> had made crooked, in the Adminiſtration of the ſupper, doth not ſend them to the practiſes of ſuch and ſuch Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, who poſſibly in their adminiſtrations, came neareſt to the inſtitution, but to the inſtitution it ſelf. Which way of the two ſhall we take for our ſatisfaction? that which Mr. <hi>A.</hi> preſcribes and follows, or that which the Scripture cited by him leads us unto? If he would have us to follow the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, we have no authority or rule of Scripture from him (if at all) ſo to do; if the latter, then he counſels us againſt his
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:118706:104"/> own practiſe, and prevaricates with his cauſe, and with the foundation on which he builds his firſt argument, <hi>viz.</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact (as himſelf calls it, <hi>p.</hi> 2.) And indeed it is the foundation of all the reſt of his arguments, and of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all of his way, upon the ſubject in hand. Nor do we deny <hi>matter of fact</hi> to be a foundation in its kind; but in what caſes, and how far, we own and reverence it in ſuch a relation, may be ſhewed in due time.</p>

To produce or ſhew unto us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe inſtitution for Baptiſm; this (probably) would ſoon comprimiſe the difference between us: Or elſe 2. To prove ſubſtantially (for, as the ſaying is, old Colts are not to be taken with chaffe, nor conſidering <hi>Christians</hi> to be ſatisfied with light or looſe conjectures) that an uſage or practiſe, though immediately following an inſtitution, yea and this with good correſpondency and conformity to the inſtitution, is notwithſtanding commenſurable to the whole councel and intent of God in the inſtitution, or holds forth and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth adequately and compleatly all that, which the inſtitution comprehendeth. Nay the certain truth is, that not onely no practication of an inſtitution, though with never ſo good conformity hereunto; but that not the letter it ſelf, or Grammatical ſence of the words of an inſtitution, do expreſs hold forth, or comprehend, the whole mind or counſel of God in any inſtitution whatſoever.

               <p>To this I cannot but adde one thing more upon the ſame account. Mr. <hi>A,</hi> knows very well, that his Brethren, from whom he diſſents in the preſent controverſie, deny that there is any inſtitution at all of Baptiſm upon record, either in the New Teſtament, or the old; yet takes no notice at all of it. And though it be matter of ſo great conſequence to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in hand, though he had ſo fair an opportunity, yea though the Scriptures cited by him impoſed a kind of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon him, to ſpeak concerning it, as either to prove that there is ſuch an inſtitution, or otherwiſe to ſhew how we may come to ſatisfaction in and about, the uſe and practiſe of Baptiſm, though there be no inſtitution, yet he waves the conſideration of it altogether. Whether this omiſſion was caſual, or prudential, ſhall be no part of our preſent enquiry. However by the light of what hath been ſaid, we plainly ſee that Mr. <hi>A.</hi> knoweth not, or at leaſt, that it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that he doth know, how to clear up unto us a way, or rule, how to receive ſatisfaction in the particular in hand. His Scriptures produced lead us to the inſtitution of God; but his beſt way, to the practiſes of ſome men. The inſtitution would be ſatisfaction unto us without the practiſes of men: but the practiſes of men without the inſtitution, do but ſatisfie us
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:118706:105"/> in part, touching the inſtitution, <hi>viz.</hi> how it may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ought, in ſuch and ſuch caſes, under ſuch and ſuch circumſtances, to be adminiſtred. Yea the truth is, that for Mr. <hi>Allen's prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes</hi> themſelves, as far as he is able from the Scriptures to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and argue them unto us, they are not, no not to ſuch a degree, ſo compleatly ſatisfactory, (as there may be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſhew afterwards,) When the inſtitution of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was given, if an eſtimate ſhould have been made of the mind of God, concerning the adequate or proper ſubject of this Ordinance, by <hi>matter of fact,</hi> or by the firſt adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, evident it is that ſuch an eſtimate would have led men into errour, notwithſtanding he that managed and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered theſe firſt adminiſtrations, was as faithful, and as good a friend of God, as either <hi>John,</hi> or the Apoſtles themſelves. For no adminiſtration was at firſt made of this Ordinance (at leaſt we read of none that was made) but onely unto perſons that had out-lived the eight day of their lives by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, as unto <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, being now 99 years old, unto <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> being 13 yeers old, <hi>aad unto every male among the MEN in</hi> Abraham'<hi>s houſe, Gen.</hi> 17. 23, 24, 25.

This his opinion touching a neceſſity of varying from a primitive practiſe, and and this impoſed by an expreſſe command, he can upon no other account tolerably juſtifie, but onely by alledging that the caſe, in reference to ſuch a practiſe is different in theſe days, from what it was in the days of the Apoſtles, when the gifts of healing were veſted in perſons of that relation in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches.

Again Mr. <hi>A.</hi> takes, or at leaſt allows a liberty to vary from the practiſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf in his primitive adminiſtration of the Supper. He adminiſtred it unto men onely; Mr. <hi>A.</hi> pleads the title of women alſo to the adminiſtration, <hi>page</hi> 11. Doubtleſſe he cannot juſtifie an adminiſtration ſo far differing from that of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in reſpect of the ſubjects of it, or perſons adminiſtred unto, but by pleading that the caſe is otherwiſe with us, in reference to the ordinary adminiſtration of the ſupper, that ought to be practiſed amongſt us, then it was with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> after this, or ſome like manner: Chriſt judging it meet to ſolemnize the firſt adminiſtration of the Supper, with his Apoſtles onely, by whom he intended to erect the ſaid admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration in all Churches thoroughout the world, had no occaſion to intereſs women therein; and beſides, the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration being yet unknown and unheard of amongſt <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> no women more then men, could ſo much as deſire part and fellow-ſhip therein. Whereas amongſt us, and in our Churches, we have women-members, as well as men, who are in the ſame capacity with men to partake in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and who deſire it with as much deſire as they: and beſides, we have no ſuch motive or occaſion, to confine our ſelves unto men in our Adminiſtrations, as the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> had in his. If then difference of caſe, and diverſity of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:118706:106"/> one or more, will juſtifie a different practiſe in all the particulars now mentioned, from thoſe, which were moſt regular and worthy in other caſes, and under differing circumſtances, is it not moſt rational to conceive &amp; conclude, that the ordinary practiſe of the Apoſtles in <hi>Baptizing Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving and Repentant perſons,</hi> (ſuppoſing it to have been ſuch) doth no waies argue or prove, but that the ordinary practiſe of baptizing children now may be more juſtifiable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then ſuch a practiſe would be, conſidering that the caſe of Chriſtianity and circumſtances relating unto Baptiſm, are ſo much altered, and differing as they are, from what they were in the Apoſtles days. In the Apoſtles days, the <hi>Beleeving and Repentant perſons</hi> whom they baptized, had not been trained up in the knowledge of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or in the profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> religion, but were newly converted unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> either from <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm,</hi> or <hi>Gentiliſm.</hi> In the like caſe, and under the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, we alſo judge that <hi>Beleeving and Repentant perſons,</hi> at leaſt profeſſors of both, and theſe onely, ought to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.

               <p>That they do not bind univerſally, is evident from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the many abſurdities, which will unavoidably follow hereupon, and which are obvious to every mans thought: In particular it would follow, that we ſhould be

               <p>1. To the major propoſition in the argument, we anſwer
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:118706:108"/> dy benying it, and give this account of our denial. Firſt no particular obſervation, or adminiſtration of an Ordinance, or inſtitution, doth, or can, anſwer or expreſſe, the whole mind or counſel of God therein (I mean in the ſaid Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or inſtitution.) When <hi>Abraham</hi> circumciſed his ſon <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack</hi> the eight day, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 4.) he did not act or expreſſe the whole counſel of God in the inſtitution of circumciſion. For the mind of God was, that men <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as well as children at eight days of age, in caſe their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was omitted, whileſt they were children. In like manner when <hi>Joſhua</hi> circumciſed men (<hi>Joſ.</hi> 5. 5. 7.) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he expreſſe herein, the full mind of God in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, as is evident: nay he herein acted expreſly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the letter of the inſtitution, which confined circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the eight day, and yet was blameleſſe. When the Prieſts and their families obſerved the Ordinance of God in eating the Shew bread, they did not herein expreſſe the whole counſel of God in this Ordinance: For this extended to a lawfulneſſe even for others alſo, who were not of any Prieſtly family, to eat of this bread, in caſe of much hunger, and defect of proviſions otherwiſe; as is evident by what <hi>David,</hi> and thoſe that were with him, did in the daies of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biathar</hi> the Prieſt. <note n="a" place="margin">Mar. 2. 26.</note> When the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerved the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Sabboth</hi> according to the greateſt preciſeneſſe of the letter that can be imagined, as when neither themſelves, ſon nor daughter, man ſervant, nor maid ſervant, cattel, nor ſtranger within their gate, did any work at all, they did not by ſuch an obſervation as this, expreſſe the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God in, and about the Sabboth. For his counſel and intent herein further was, that they ſhould do good on the Sabboth day, as well as on any other day, as in miniſtring unto the ſick, in helping an Oxe or an Aſſe out of a ditch or pit, whereinto they were fallen, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> Our Saviour himſelf in his adminiſtration of the ſupper, did not act to the extent or compaſſe of his own counſel and intendment in the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For he did not adminiſter it unto women, when as notwithſtanding, we generally beleeve (and this upon ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient grounds) that his intentions in the inſtitution reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto theſe alſo. From hence then it evidently follows,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:118706:108"/> that <hi>John</hi>'s, and ſo <hi>Chriſts,</hi> and the Apoſtles, adminiſtring Baptiſm unto Beleevers or Repentant perſons onely, and not unto Infants, is no ſufficient argument or proof, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was no part of Gods intent in the inſtitution of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, that it ſhould be adminiſtred unto infants. God (as hath been ſaid, and ſhewed) alwaies intends more in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, then any adminiſtration of it doth expreſſe.</p>

               <p>If it be here replied; that in caſe it had been any part of the mind of God, in the inſtitution of Baptiſm, that infants ſhould partake of it, it is no ways likely but that either <hi>John,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or one or other of the Apoſtles, would firſt or laſt have made the adminiſtration unto them; I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It hath not yet been proved, (nor I beleeve, ever will) that none of theſe ever made an adminiſtration of Baptiſm unto infants. But more of this in our anſwer to the minor propoſition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why is it not as likely, ſuppoſing the counſel of God in the inſtitution we ſpeak of, to ſtand as well for the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of Infants, as of men, that yet neither <hi>John, Chriſt,</hi> nor any the Apoſtles, ſhould baptize infants, as that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould baptize onely ſo few, as himſelf reporteth he did, <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 14, 15, 16.</note> when as according to the counſel of God, he might have bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed twenty times as many, yea and (doubtleſſe) had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to have done it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) As the reaſon why <hi>Paul</hi> baptized ſo few as he did (and I ſuppoſe he had not ſinned, in caſe he had not baptized theſe, yea or any at all) was, becauſe he had another work of far greater weight, worth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment unto him, to lay out himſelf upon (<hi>viz</hi> the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel) then baptizing was; in like manner, <hi>John, Chriſt,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, probably did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and judge, that it did more principally in thoſe times, concern them to look after, and provide for the baptizing of men and women, then of children; and upon this account might, though not neglect, yet omit, the baptizing of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Yet this doth no waies prove, but that it might be lawfull for them to have baptized children; as (queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) it was lawfull for <hi>Paul</hi> to have baptized a thouſand

               <p>2. We deny the conſequence in the ſaid major Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon another account alſo, which is this.

This is ſo evident, both in the Scriptures, and in reaſon it ſelf, that I ſuppoſe I may without loſſe, ſpare the proof of it.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>John, Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. might upon conſideration of ſome circumſtance, one, or more (poſſibly unknown unto us) forbear the baptizing of infants in their daies, though a practice lawful enough, and ordinarily, in Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, neceſſary. And whereas Mr. <hi>A.</hi> pleads the cauſe of his propoſition, or conſequence, which, upon the grounds now ſpecified, we deny, by this reaſon, <hi>viz.

If they did forbear the ſaid practiſe altogether, and never baptize any infant, in the next place we deny that the reaſons of their forbearance are bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto us, until 1. They be declared and made known to us what they were; and 2. Untill it be proved that thoſe reaſons, upon which they forbear, (in caſe they did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear) have the ſame influence upon, or relation unto, us, which they had upon, and unto them. For it is not reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that we ſhould ſuſpend, or forbear, the doing of that, which we conceive to be a duty, and that upon ſuch grounds,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:118706:109"/> which were never yet (at leaſt to our judgements) ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently anſwered, or diſproved, onely becauſe it was not done (or rather becauſe ſome conceive it was not done) in the days of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Apoſtles; eſpecially conſidering that we are able to give a competent account, (at leaſt) to our ſelves; yea and (we ſuppoſe) to others alſo, who are not too deeply baptized into a ſpirit of prejudice and partiality (which in ſuch a caſe as this we judge ſufficient) why they did, or might forbear, in caſe it ſhould be proved that they did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear in this kind. This account we briefly mentioned, §. 15. and may ſomewhat inlarge upon it in place convenient. In the mean time we clearly ſee that hitherto Mr. <hi>A.</hi> hath one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleared doubts by darkneſſe; and by the reaſon or proof exhibited, hath mediated no good accord between the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent and Antecedent in his major propoſition. For were both theſe granted. 1. That <hi>John</hi> and the Apoſtles did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear infant-baptiſm in their daies: and 2. <hi>That that which was a reaſon unto them to forbear it, ought to be a reaſon unto all men now to forbear it, (viz.</hi> in caſe <hi>all men</hi> had the ſame <hi>reaſon now,</hi> I mean, were under the influence or command of the ſame or the like reaſon) yet doth it no waies follow from hence, that therefore if they forbear infant-baptiſm, all men ought to forbear it now. The reaſon of the <hi>non-ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi> is, becauſe God may ſubject one man, or ſome men, to a neceſſity of ſome forbearance, by ſuch a reaſon, <hi>in indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duo,</hi> or <hi>in actu excercito</hi> (as the School-men ſpeak) by which all men are ſubjected to the like forbearance, <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> or <hi>in actu ſignato,</hi> who yet may never actually, or <hi>in indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duo,</hi> be ſubjected hereunto, by this reaſon.</p>
               <p>As for example, the command of God, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the motion of the ſpirit of God in men, to forbear ſuch or ſuch a practiſe, is <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> and in the general, equally binding unto all men as to this forbearance. All men are alike bound (I mean, one man is bound, as well as another) to obey every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, that ſhall be directed to him, or impoſed on him. But in caſe ſuch a command be directed and given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome particular men, and not unto others, (and there is the ſame conſideration of an inward motion of the ſpirit) it
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:118706:110"/> doth not follow, that becauſe the former are bound by it to the ſuppoſed particular forbearance, that therefore the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> to whom this command is not given, ſhould be bound likewiſe, though the command of God, ſimply conſidered, be alike binding unto all. Therefore in caſe <hi>John,</hi> and the Apoſtles, were moved by the ſpirit of God to forbear the baptizing of Infants, (which I preſume Mr. <hi>A.</hi> himſelf will not deny) and upon this motion did forbear it, it doth not follow from their being moved hereunto, that thoſe who are not moved, as they were, are, or ſhould be bound by their motion, to the like forbearance. Particular motions of Gods ſpirit unto actions (and there is the ſame reaſon of forbearances alſo) either beſides, or contrary unto, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and known rules, or laws, bind no man, but onely thoſe particularly inſpired and moved by them, either to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or forbearances, unto which theſe perſons are moved or led by them. But that as well <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, did forbear the baptizing of infants, in caſe it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that they did forbear it (which was never yet ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially proved, nor I beleeve ever will be) by ſpecial and particular direction or motion of the Holy Ghoſt, and not otherwiſe, is clearly demonſtrable by this argument. Either (upon the ſaid ſuppoſition) they did forbear it by particular and expreſſe motion from the Holy Ghoſt, or elſe by ſome ſtanding order, rule, or direction, recorded in the Scriptures or elſe by the motion or guidance of their own ſpirits. But they forbear it not upon either of theſe latter accounts. Therefore their forbearance (upon the ſuppoſition mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) was by extraordinary and particular motion of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt. If Mr. <hi>A.</hi> will ſay, that their forbearance was grounded upon any general or ſtanding law or rule of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, let him produce ſuch, whether law, or rule, from hence, whereby men are prohibited or reſtrained from baptizing infants. If he ſhall do this, the controverſie between him and his Antagoniſts about Infant-Baptiſm, will ſoon be at an end. That the ſaid perſons (<hi>John,</hi> and the Apoſtles) did not forbear Infant-Baptiſm, out of the private dictate or moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their own ſpirits, Mr. <hi>A.</hi> (I preſume) will not affirm, in which reſpect it needs no proof.</p>

               <p>But whereas we might here regularly have expected to ſee the reaſons, why, as Mr. <hi>A.</hi> pretends, Baptiſm was not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred unto infants in the daies of <hi>John, &amp;c.</hi> behold quite another viſion.

And thus whileſt we were in expectance of ſome arguments from him to confirm his argument, he hath ſlidden from us like a Serpent over a rock, and we find him again creeping in at a whole on the other ſide. But let us follow him at this turn alſo, and draw him forth into the light.</p>
               <p>He makes an enumeration or recital of five reaſons, which may be pretended for infant-baptiſm now, and which ſome may think were not obligatory unto them (<hi>John,</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and cloſeth (with confidence more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, as if he had ſurveyed the round world, and all that is therein.) <hi>Other</hi> [reaſons] <hi>then theſe cannot lightly be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or imagined ever to come up into the minds of men.</hi> Mr. <hi>A.</hi> was not comprehenſive enough at this turn, there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſons here, which lie without the verge or circle of his imagination here; two of which have been already mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſhall (upon this occaſion) be again repeated, and a little further opened.</p>

               <p>1. We may be in a better, and more convenient capacity for baptizing infants now, then they were, becauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, yea and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, had a buſineſſe of far greater weight and moment lying upon their hand, then baptizing, not onely infants, but even beleevers themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> the planting of the Goſpel in the world, the conſtituting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in compariſon of which, the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of baptizing, whether one ſort of perſons, or other, was but of an under conſequence. And that <hi>de facto,</hi> they many times did, upon the account we ſpeak of, omit other
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:118706:111"/> things as neceſſary as this (yea by many degrees more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnry) ſufficently aippears in that for the Goſpels ſake, &amp; mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry thereof, they frequently expoſed themſelves to all kinds of hazards, neglected their healths and lives, the preſervation of which (being a work of mercy) was of more conſequence, then any ſuch ſacrifice as the Baptiſm of infants is, yea or of beleevers themſelves. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in ſaying, that <hi>he was not ſent to baptize, but to preach the Gospel</hi> (though yet he did baptize, as lawfully he might by his comiſſion) clearly implies, that baptizing, in compariſon of preaching the Goſpel, was but an inferior imployment, &amp; which he ought at ſome turns to omit, <hi>viz.</hi> when it fell nor in conveniently with his greater occaſions (as will further appear afterwards) yea baptizing, whether one or other, was of ſo ſmal a conſideration in the eys of the Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in compariſon of the preaching of the Goſpel, that at the firſt ſending forth of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Apoſtles to preach the Goſpel (<hi>Mat. 18. Mar. 3. Luke</hi> 9.) yea and when a while after, he ſent forth ſeventy other Diſciples about the ſame work, he ſpake not a word either to the one, or the other, about baptizing any. So then this is one reaſon, not reducible to any of Mr. <hi>A</hi>'s five, why that Miniſters of the Goſpel, and Paſtors and Elders of Churches in theſe days, may be reputed in a better capacity for the baptizing of children, then the Apoſtles, and thoſe that were aſſiſtants unto them in their daies, were.</p>

               <p>2. As <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> were once <hi>forbidden by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to preach the Goſpel it ſelf, for a time in ſuch a place, where otherwiſe they were then minded to have preached it, <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 16. 6.</note> yea and where they did preach it afterwards, <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 19. 10. 26.</note> by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the ſame ſpirit, ſo why may we not conceive, that in caſe the Apoſtles, and other Baptiſts in their times, did forbear the baptizing of infants, they might receive a ſecret prohibition of the Holy Ghoſt in that behalf, not becauſe the practiſe was any whit more unlawfull, then the preaching of the Goſpel was in <hi>Aſia,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from it, but becauſe the will and pleaſure of God was, that they ſhould forbear it for a time? And I beleeve we are

If then <hi>John,</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by ſpecial order, advice, or admonition from the Holy Ghoſt, refrained the baptizing of infants in their daies, it followeth not, but that we, who in theſe daies, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no ſuch order, advice, or admonition from the Holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ghoſt, neither by any word from the Scriptures, nor by any inward motion or inſpiration, may lawfully practiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſm, notwithſtanding their forbearance; eſpecially conſidering that we judge our ſelves incouraged, yea obliged hereunto, by the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking unto us as he doth, in the Scriptures.</p>

               <p>This is a ſecond conſideration (over and above thoſe five ſuggeſted by Mr. <hi>A.</hi>) proving that we in our daies may be in a regular, yea in an obliging capacity for baptizing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, although <hi>John,</hi> the Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their daies were
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:118706:112"/> not. We do not in all this imply, or ſuppoſe, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles or other primitive men, did alwaies, or altogether omit baptizing infants; our judgement is (as we ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declare in our examination of the minor propoſition) that infants were, even in the Apoſtles daies baptized; but onely ſhew and prove, that in caſe it could be proved that they did never baptize infants, yet this doth at no hand lead us to the like forbearance, much leſſe impoſe a neceſſity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us by way of duty, of the like. So that Mr. <hi>A</hi>'s argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or proof of his major propoſition, from enumeration of ſome particulars, is not altogether ſo good, as the young mans proof of his integrity, from his obſervance of ſeveral of the commandements of God was.

                  <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 18. 22</note> But Mr. <hi>A</hi>'s argument lacketh two things at leaſt, and who knoweth how many more? And in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this his argument, he windeth up much more, then he had ſpun in the premiſes. For thus he concludes: <hi>And therefore what ever the reaſons, or conſiderations were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they</hi> (the primitive Baptiſts) <hi>did forbear to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize infants, the ſame are binding to all men in theſe daies to forbear it likewiſe.</hi> Will you pleaſe to conſider how this hath been proved? Becauſe (ſaith he) <hi>we have no other reaſons for the doing of it then they had.</hi> This reaſon ſtands by the ſaid concluſion, as <hi>David</hi>'s friends ſtood by him, when God (as he complains) had <hi>put them far from him.</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Pſa. 88. 18.</note> For what though it were granted (which yet hath been denied, and a good account given of the denial) that we have no other reaſons to baptize infants, then they had, yet is it no legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate conſequence from hence, that therefore their reaſons of forbearance, are to be our reaſons, or reaſons unto us, why we alſo ſhould forbear ſuch a practiſe. For they might have all the ſame reaſons for baptizing infants, which we have; and yet their reaſons might poſſibly, as to them, be overballanced with others of a contrary import, upon which they might forbear the ſaid practiſe.

Either this muſt be his inference from theſe Scriptures: or elſe his cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them is no waies relative to his purpoſe.

I conclude therefore (ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter, p.</hi> 116. of his Diſcourſe for Infant-Church-memberſhip, and Baptiſm) that it is a moſt evident truth, that Chriſt did not ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Infants-Church-memberſhip, becauſe it was a known truth beyond controverſie. Nor was there any one man found in thoſe days (that we read of) that ever denied it: and all the Jews, yea and all other Church-members were in actual poſſeſſion of it, and Chriſt never queſtioned their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. Upon the like account it very well may be that there is ſo much ſpoken in the New-Teſtament of the baptizing of men and women, and ſo little (or nothing at all, in ſo many words) of the baptizing of children. The frequent mention of men and women baptized, may with as much probability (if not more) argue, that the firſt adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Baptiſm were out of courſe, and contrary to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſetled by the inſtitution, made unto them, as that they ſhould be exemplary or binding unto future ages: As the recording of ſo many men circumciſed, about the firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Circumciſion, was not intended to make theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations ſtandingly or in ordinary caſes, exemplary, or obligatory unto after-times, becauſe this had been to defeat the expreſs letter of the inſtitution; but rather to ſhew that in like caſes, and under like circumſtances, <hi>viz.</hi> when male Jews, or Proſelites had not been circumciſed the eight day, they might be circumciſed afterwards, when ever they had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.

               <p>If children were not baptized by the Apoſtles, or in their daies, it is at no hand to be beleeved, that the Holy Ghoſt would have caſt any ſuch ſnare upon the <hi>Chriſtian world</hi> in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-times, as ſo frequent a report of houſholds and families baptized, made in the New-Teſtament, and this without any limitation, or exception of perſons, amounteth unto; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering that it both was, and is, a thing generally known, that under the Divine diſpenſation immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding (I mean, that of <hi>Moſes</hi>) children in families were the more appropriate ſubject of that Ordinance, which was a ſeal of the ſame Covenant with baptiſm [viz. <hi>of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Faith, i. e.</hi> of remiſſion of ſins upon beleving, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. as we ſhall evince and prove in due time] and did perform the ſame, or like ſervice (in the main) unto the Church of God under the Law, which Baptiſm now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth under the Goſpel (as ſome of the Doctors of the way of Ana-baptiſm themſelves do acknowledge; though Mr. <hi>A.</hi> following his over-confident and ſufficiently-ignorant leader, weeneth otherwiſe.)

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:118706:114"/> were no children in thoſe families, which are reported to have been baptized by the Apoſtles, or by their order, yet from the very tenor of this expreſſion, that they <hi>baptized Houſholds,</hi> it is evident enough that they did baptize children; or (that which is every waies equivalent hereunto) that the mind of the Holy Ghoſt is, that children ſhould be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.

Or if the intent of the Holy Ghoſt had been, that onely actual Beleevers in an houſe ſhould be baptized, would he have informed the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world, that <hi>houſholds,</hi> whole <hi>houſholds,</hi> or <hi>all</hi> in an houſe, were baptized, without giving ſome intimation at leaſt, that children in every houſe were, &amp; ought to be excepted?

               <p>5. To me it is one of the Congregation of the firſt born of <hi>Probabilities,</hi> that the <hi>Children brought to Chriſt,</hi> with a deſire in them that brought them, that <hi>he ſhould lay his hands on them and pray (Mat. 19. 13. &amp;c.</hi>) had been already bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. For it is expreſly ſaid <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 16. that <hi>he put,</hi> or laid <hi>his hands upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we never read in the New-Teſtament, of the laying on of hands upon any unbaptized perſon, unleſſe (haply) it were in order to the working of ſome miraculous cure on him, on whom they were laid, See <hi>Mar. 5. 5. 8. 23. Mar. 16. 18. Luke 4. 40. Luke 13. 13. Acts 9. 17. Acts</hi> 28. 8. In all other caſes impoſition of hands was practiſed upon baptized perſons onely, <hi>Acts 6. 6. Acts 8. 17. Acts 13. 3. Acts 19. 6. 1 Tim. 4. 14. 2 Tim.</hi> 1 6. And more uſually this impoſition of hands was practiſed on thoſe that had, either formerly, or lately, been baptized, and this in order to the receiving of the Holy Ghoſt, the Apoſtles (it ſeems, haply with ſome Elders of Churches beſides, in thoſe daies) having received this gift from God, <hi>viz.</hi> by laying on of hands and prayer, to obtain and impart the gift of the Holy Ghoſt unto Chriſtians. Yea ſeveral Churches of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts themſelves amongſt us, glory in the outward cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of laying on hands upon their proſelytes newly bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, as if they were the Apoſtles heirs, and by deſcent inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited all their ſpiritual royalties, and heavenly prerogatives; herein much reſembling that ridiculous effeminate Emperor, who out of a fooliſh deſire to be thought <hi>Hercules,</hi> or a man of ſtrength and courage like unto him, would needs attire himſelf with a Lyons skin. But now it no waies appears, nor is it in it ſelf a thing likely, that the children we ſpeak of were brought unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to obtain any cure of any malady or diſeaſe from him. Beſides if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had performed any miraculous cure upon them, there is little queſtion but that this would as well, yea much rather, have been mentioned
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:118706:115"/> by the Evangeliſts, at leaſt one or other of them, as his lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of hands upon them. Therefore (in all likelihood) they were baptized before they were brought to <hi>Christ,</hi> to obtain the laying on of his hands upon them. Or if we ſhall ſay that <hi>Chriſt</hi> layed hands on them that they might receive the Holy Ghoſt (ſuppoſing them at preſent un-baptized) yet being made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, by, or upon, the laying on of <hi>Christs</hi> hands, they were hereby put into an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate capacity of receiving Baptiſm, according to that of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Acts 10. 47. Can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, which have received the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, as well as we?</hi> And what other benefit or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould intend to theſe children, or conferre by laying hands on them, but the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, when Mr. <hi>A.</hi> demonſtrates unto me, I ſhall demur upon the place.</p>

               <p>To the teſtimonies and authorities of ancient writers, who are one and all in aſſerting the lineal deſcent of Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm from the Apoſtles, I ſhall onely ſubjoin the ſence and judgement in the caſe of that learned and worthy Martyr in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies, Mr. <hi>John Philpot,</hi> in a letter written to a fellow priſoner of his at the ſame time in <hi>Newgate,</hi> recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the book of Martyrs, <hi>Vol. 3. pag.</hi> 606. of the laſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. <hi>A.</hi> 1555. together with a teſtimony from <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert L. Brook,</hi> cited by Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> for Anti-poedo-baptiſm, in which reſpect I conceive his teſtimony will be the more paſſable with Mr. <hi>A.</hi> and men of his judgement. But firſt in one place the Martyr ſaith: <hi>Now will I prove with manifeſt arguments that children ought to be baptized, and that THE APOSTLES OF CHRIST DID BAPTIZE CHIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DREN.</hi> In another, <hi>Since the Apoſtles were the Preachers of the word, and the very faithfull ſervants of Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who may hereafter doubt, that THEY BAPTIZED IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FANTS, ſince Baptiſm is in place of Circumciſion?</hi> In a third. <hi>Therefore we may conclude, that THE APOSTLES DID BAPTIZE INFANTS OR CHILDREN, and not onely men of lawfull age.</hi> More of like import might be cited from this letter, if it were needfull. So that unleſſe Mr. <hi>A.</hi> or men of his mind, can produce ſome negative teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, or witneſſe from the Scripture, which do as expreſly
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:118706:118"/> deny the baptizing of children by the Apoſtles, as theſe late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produced by me, and many more in far greater numbers produced by others, do affirm it, the affirmative is to be taken for truth, and this by the expreſſe law of God mentioned, which ſaith, <hi>that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes every word ſhall be eſtabliſhed.</hi> This Law was made by God to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-rule and iſſue caſes and queſtions of life and death; and conſequently of far greater import, then whether children were baptized or no, by the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the L. <hi>Brook,</hi> his words (towards the end of his book concerning Epiſcopacy) are theſe: <hi>Firſt, for ought I could ever learn, it was the conſtan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>It may be Mr. <hi>A.</hi> will object, that the witneſſes intended by God in his law, are onely ſuch, who can ſpeak to the caſe in queſtion upon their own knowledge, as having been either eye-witneſſes, or ear-witneſſes themſelves, of what they teſtifie; not ſuch who teſtifie upon the credit or aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, that <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Ireneus, Origen, Cyprian, Auguſtine,</hi> (with many other ſtudious and learned men about their times) all things conſidered, had as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, as unqueſtionable grounds, for what they teſtifie concerning the practiſe of Infant-baptiſm by the Apoſtles, as a witneſſe, who ſpeaks or gives evidence, upon the credit of his eyes, can reaſonably be ſuppoſed to have, for ſuch his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. For as it is poſſible for a man to have a myſt caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:118706:118"/> his eyes, or to ſuffer ſuch a <hi>Deceptio viſûs,</hi> a deception of his ſignt, that may occaſion him to beleeve with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that he ſeeth ſuch or ſuch a thing, which (indeed) he ſeeth not, yet this poſſibility diſ-ableth no mans teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who giveth evidence upon the authority of his eyes; in like manner there being no more then a bare poſſibility (and this not degreed neither like the other) that the Authors mentioned ſhould be miſtaken in the grounds, upon which they build their teſtimony of the practice of Infant-Baptiſm by the Apoſtles, it is very importune, diſ-ingenuous, and hardly conſiſtent with a good conſcience, for any man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject their teſtimony in the caſe. And if Mr. <hi>A.</hi> himſelf, and three or four more of his judgement, of equall repute with him for ſober and conſcientious men (although I beleeve his new opinion and way hath not at all tenerized, or bettered his conſcience, nor any other mans) ſhould report any thing upon grounds as pregnant with evidence of truth unto them, as the grounds upon which the fathers teſtified the baptizing of children by the Apoſtles, were unto them, I ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much ſcruple beleeve him, yea though the thing report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him in this caſe, ſhould in it ſelf be much more incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, then that children were baptized by the Apoſtles. Nor is it at any hand to be beleeved or thought, that the ſaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors (their gravity, wiſdom, intereſt and authority in the Churches of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in their daies, over and beſides the moſt approved goodneſſe of their Conſciences, conſidered) would upon conjectural or light grounds, or ſuch which had been liable to dis-proof, aſſerted any ſuch matter of fact as that. Yea (that which is more then this) their adverſaries themſelves (I mean the Pelagians, who were great oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and the Orthodox Fathers about his daies) men of great learning, ſubtile, diligent and ſtudious in their way, againſt whoſe Doctrine and Tenents, the baptizing of infants, was one of the grand arguments or objections, urged and inſiſted on by the Orthodox Fathers, yet never denied, or ſo much as queſtioned the truth of what they conſtantly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, touching the deſcent of Infant-Baptiſm from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:118706:119"/>
               <p>To pretend, that the writings at this day paſſing under the names of the fore-named fathers, may for ought we know, be ſpurious and counterfeit, or elſe depraved and corrupted, and that upon this account, the authority of any thing found in them, is not much to be valued; thus (I ſay) to pretend argue, and conclude, is worthy onely ſuch men, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences will ſerve them rather to ſay any thing, and to ſeek out any frivolous or puted evaſion, then to yeeld to the truth. However if Mr. <hi>A.</hi> can offer any thing for proof of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative (that children were not baptized by the Apoſtles) which in the eye of unpartial and conſidering men, doth any waies, to any proportion, or degree, ballance the weight of what hath been alledged from many competent witneſſes for the affirmative, I ſhall let go the hold I have taken on the credit of their teſtimony in the caſe, which untill then I ſuppoſe himſelf will judge meet and <hi>Christian</hi> that I ſhould keep. In the mean time the premiſes, together with what we ſhall upon ſomewhat a like account, immediately ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join, conſidered; I do with very little leſſe confidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that Children were baptized in the Apoſtles daies, then I beleeve the Sunne to be up at noon day.

               <p>7. It is very conſiderable alſo for the diſcovery of the truth in the buſineſſe in hand, that the times, when (and for the moſt part, the occaſions whereupon) thoſe additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal ceremonies which for a long time accompanied the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of infants, as God-fathers, and God-mothers (ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) with ſome others, had their firſt riſe and original, may from current hiſtories, be ſhewed and found. Whereas no hiſtory whatſoever undertaketh to report, when the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of infants came firſt into the Church; which is no light argument or proof, that this practiſe was more ancient then any Eccleſiaſtical hiſtory now extant; and conſequently, as ancient as the times of the Apoſtles. For it is altogether improbable, that any Hiſtory ſhould take notice of appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, or additional circumſtances, and record the time of their introduction into the Church, and not withall take and

               <p>Thoſe who of later times, and ſince the beginning of the Reformation attempted firſt by <hi>Luther,</hi> revived this oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereas before the followers of the Lamb, as well as of the Beaſt, had continued the practice of baptizing infants time out of mind (as the ſaying is) without interruption, are known to have been one <hi>Nicholas Ciconia</hi> (in Engliſh <hi>Stork) Mark Stubner, Martin Cellar,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Munster;</hi> theſe in the yeer, 1521. went up and down from place to place in <hi>Germany,</hi> and inſnared many unlearned and ſimple people, with their <hi>pernicious Doctrine</hi> (as my Author termeth it.) Their manner was, to boaſt of colloquies (or private confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences) with God, to talk and inveigh both againſt Miniſters of the Goſpel, and men in civil authority: to clamour, that all things in the Church were corrupt and out of order, and therefore muſt be reduced, that there muſt be a new Church built, and the Citizens [or members] initiated with a ſecond Baptiſm. What kind of perſons theſe were, together with the far greateſt part of thoſe, whom they drew into their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:118706:120"/> how they diſturbed both the Eccleſiaſtical and civil peace in all places (almoſt) where they came, eſpecially where they grew to any head or numbers conſiderable, I ſhall forbear here to relate, referring the Reader deſirous of ſatisfaction in ſuch particulars, to unpartial hiſtories of thoſe times. Or to contract his labour in this kind, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend unto him (upon this account) the peruſal onely of the 14th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chapter of the ſecond part of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s book, intituled, <hi>Plain Scripture Proof for Infants Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Baptiſm.</hi> Onely I ſhall mention this concerning <hi>Martin Cellar,</hi> one of the four, and the learnedſt man of them, that after he had ſtood by his ſect ſeveral years, and had writ much for it, at laſt perceiving that his party decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and matters did not anſwer his expectation, he went and ſetled at <hi>Baſil,</hi> married and lived quietly, taught Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and as being aſhamed to be known or called by that name, under which he had profeſſed Ana-baptiſm, he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his name from <hi>Cellarius</hi> into <hi>Borrhaus;</hi> under which name he wrote learned Commentaries upon the five books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> with ſome others, which are now extant under this name.</p>
               <p>By the way, I marvell not a little, upon what ground Mr. <hi>A.</hi> and his partiſans can ſatisfie themſelves touching the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentiqueneſſe of their new Baptiſms, conſidering that (which I ſuppoſe is their own principle alſo) that no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized Perſon hath any right, or is in any regular capacity to adminiſter Baptiſm; and conſequently that Baptiſm admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by, and received from ſuch a perſon, is a meer nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and no true Baptiſm. For all perſons baptized in infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, being judged by them unbaptized, and there being no other but ſuch in the nation, when their new Baptiſm was firſt adminiſtred here, it undeniably follows, that the firſt adminiſtration of it was a meer nullity: and upon this account how the ſecond, or third, or thouſandth, or ten thouſandth adminiſtration ſhould become any other then a nullity alſo, and this according to their own principles, I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. And to prove that their firſt adminiſtration here, had an immediate Commiſſion from God, as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> had, or
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:118706:121"/> from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as poſſibly the Apoſtles had, to erect that kind of Baptiſm in this Nation, which he adminiſtred, is (I ſuppoſe) far above the line of their learning: Certain I am, that they muſt aſcend far above that which is written, to prove it.</p>

Now then if <hi>Chriſt</hi> or his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſhould by their new Doctrine of the Goſpel, againſt which they ſought all manner of exceptions and pretences lightly imaginable, have excluded their children, not onely from circumciſion it ſelf, but from all other accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or priviledges whatſoever, that ſhould any waies anſwer, or counterpoize it, is it to be beleeved that they would have taken no notice of it, or made it no matter of offence and quarrel? Or if they did ſtumble at it, and diſparage or fault the Goſpel, or the managing of it in the world upon ſuch an account, can it be thought that the Holy Ghoſt would have
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:118706:121"/> made no record of ſuch a thing, nor yet of Chriſts or the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles vindication or juſtification of themſelves and their practice againſt ſuch an imputation; eſpecially conſidering that very many things are recorded by him of far leſſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then ſuch a vindication would have been?

Yea Mr. <hi>Laurence</hi> (for the Treatiſe intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Of Baptiſm,</hi> is generally reputed his, and is none of the worſt pieces written in the cauſe of Anti-poedo-Baptiſm) to ſalve his notion of the neceſſity of dipping, if it may be, out of the hand of the Holy Ghoſt, recording the baptizing of the Jaylor and his houſhold by <hi>Paul,</hi> to have been in the night, is pleaſed to ſuppoſe, that <hi>in thoſe Eaſtern and hotter Countries, bathing was of great, and continual uſe;</hi> and that in this reſpect, <hi>the keeper of the Priſon MIGHT be provided of ſome veſſel fit for bathing and waſhing the whole body, which might ſerve for the uſe of Baptiſm.</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, pag. 81, 82.</note> I confeſſe this is a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ingenious conceit to help a lame notion over the wall, that ſtandeth in the way; but in the mean time, we ſee how the greateſt Patrons of Anti-poedo-Baptiſm are neceſſitated to Sanctuary their cauſe under the ſhadow of their wits and fancies, the Scriptures ever and anon forſaking them, and many times riſing up againſt them. They tell us, that we build onely upon conſequences and deductions from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein we are fallible, and ſubject to errour: but certainly the weakeſt of our conſequences, are much ſtronger then ſuch ſuppoſitions as this, and more relative to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Yea the very truth is, that themſelves hold nothing, that reacheth their cauſe in oppoſition unto us, but onely conſequences, ſuch as they are, pretended from the Scriptures. They never yet produced (nor ever will) any Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wherein Infant-Baptiſm is in expreſſeneſſe of words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be unlawfull. Therefore they who undertake to prove it ſuch from the Scriptures, muſt of neceſſity levy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences to ſerve in their warfare. But the late mentioned Author, to preſerve <hi>dipping</hi> from drowning in the Jaylors baptiſm, makes two ſuppoſitions, (like two corkes) one upon another, neither of which hath ſo much as one duſt or

That this veſſel <hi>ſerved for the uſe of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> [by dipping.] If his intent was onely to affirm and ſay, that he <hi>MIGHT have ſuch a Veſſel;</hi> and again, that ſuch a <hi>Veſſel MIGHT ſerve for Baptiſm,</hi> he ſuppoſeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed nothing, but what may well be ſuppoſed; but withall, ſaith nothing to his purpoſe. But this by the way. Onely evident it is upon the credit of my Author, that in the hotter Regions of the earth, going into the water, could be no great affliction to the fleſh; as neither is it in theſe colder Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates themſelves in warm ſeaſons, as well boys as men going into rivers, and dowſing themſelves over head and ears for their pleaſure. Therefore an unwillingneſſe to adminiſter Baptiſm in rivers, is no likely motive, occaſion, or temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to have diverted the primitive and worthy Biſhops and Paſtors of Chriſtian Churches from ſuch an adminiſtration of it, to an adminiſtration by ſprinkling, had they apprehended it to be the onely regular adminiſtration. How otherwiſe the ſprinkling of infants ſhould accommodate the intereſt of the fleſh, more then the baptizing of Beleevers in Rivers, is (as far as I can apprehend) of no eaſie conjecture.

Neither did he decree ſimply the practiſe of it, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his decree confirmed the practiſe of it; or rather (as the Pontifician Hiſtorians themſelves report) confirmed the practiſe, or the neceſſity of the practiſe of it, for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of original ſin; or (which is the ſame, at leaſt as he ſeems to have interpreted it) for the inlargement of the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> I confeſſe the practiſe we ſpeak of (In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm) is a means very proper for the inlargement of the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> though not by taking away original ſin, but by a timely ingagement of the perſons baptized, to the obedience and ſervice of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (of which, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be to ſpeak more hereafter.)

Or is it reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that when <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, that the Diſciples accompanied <hi>Paul</hi> on his way, <hi>with their wives and children,</hi> that his intent or meaning ſhould be, that they accompanied him with their baptized <hi>wives,</hi> and unbaptized <hi>children?</hi> or that the Apoſtle ſhould accept of a Linſey-woolſey retinue, compounded partly of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> partly of Pagans, or little Heathens?

                  </note> evaſion of Mr. <hi>Fiſhers, viz.</hi> that the impoſition of hands here recorded to have been adminiſtred by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> unto the children brought to him, was <hi>another kind of impoſition, viz.</hi> that which was frequently uſed in order to cures or heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, not that which pre-ſuppoſed baptiſm, is magiſterial e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough (as ſeventy times ſeven aſſertions more in the ſame book with it are) but altogether proof-leſſe. The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hereunto is, little leſſe, then clearly demonſtrable upon theſe grounds. 1. There is no intimation in the context, that any of theſe children (much leſſe all of them) were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſick, or diſeaſed. Now there can (I beleeve) no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance be produced, where, any, young or old, either came, or were brought, to Chriſt, to obtain any cure or healing from him, whoſe infirmity or diſeaſe was not mentioned and named. 2. Whereas all the miraculous cures wrought by Chriſt, are either particularly (as when he wrought but onely one, or ſome few in the ſame place) or elſe in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral (as when he wrought many in places neer adjoyning) recorded, here is not the leaſt or lighteſt mention (in one kind, or other) of any cure wrought upon theſe children by him. 3. Had the children been any waies ſick, or diſeaſed, it is at no hand credible that the Diſciples would have rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thoſe that brought them: it would have argued want of common civility, yea of humanity it ſelf to have done it. 4. The reaſon given by <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto his Diſciples (and in them unto others) why they ſhould rather, countenance and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then reſtrain or hinder the acceſſe of little children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe of ſuch was the Kingdom of God, Mar. 10. 14. or the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven, Mat</hi> 19. 14. ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:118706:129"/> declareth, that they were brought unto him upon a ſpiritual account, or in order to the obtaining of ſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual benefit, or priviledge, rather then for any bodily cure. 5. The general order of Chriſt directed unto the Diſciples, and in them unto all men, to <hi>ſuffer</hi> not thoſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children in particular, that were now brought unto him, but <hi>little children</hi> in general, to come unto him [<hi>Suffer,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>little children, and forbid them not to come unto me, Mat.</hi> 19. 14.] this general order (I ſay) and injunction of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> plainly ſhews, that his will was, that <hi>little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> ſhould be brought unto him, whether they had any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ailment upon them, or no: inaſmuch as there is nothing more certain, then that all little children have not bodily ailments or diſeaſes. And if his will be, that <hi>little children</hi> in general, and whether diſeaſed, or no, ſhould come, or be brought unto him, doubtleſſe the reaſon or end why he ordereth their comming to him, muſt needs be the receiving of ſome ſpiritual grace, benefit, or priviledge from him, and this by means of ſuch their comming.</p>
               <p>6. It is ſaid <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 16. that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not onely lay his hands upon theſe children, but that he <hi>bleſſed th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:118706:130"/> In the mean time, I ſhall take notice of theſe words (towards the cloſe of Mr. <hi>A</hi>'s third proof of his minor) that <hi>if the baptizing of Infants had been AN ORDINANCE OF GOD, the knowledge of it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Well may the baptizing of the one, or the other, be the precept, or will of God: but certainly, the ſubject of an <hi>inſtitution</hi> or <hi>Ordinance,</hi> or the perſon to whom an Ordinance is, according to the will of God, to be adminiſtred, is no part of the Ordinance it ſelf. Neither <hi>Abraham</hi> nor <hi>Iſaack</hi> were any eſſential part of circumciſion. This is Mr. <hi>Fiſhers</hi> Doctrine it ſelf, who (<hi>Baby-baptiſm, p.</hi> 211.) complains of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> (I know not well whom he means, at leaſt extenſively) for <hi>adding other ſubjects</hi> to Gods <hi>Ordinaces.</hi> In which expreſſion he plainly enough makes an <hi>Ordinance</hi> a thing by it ſelf, and the ſubject another by it ſelf. In which reſpect, he is no more conſiſtent with himſelf, then with the principles of Chriſtian modeſty, when he thus rates his oppoſers, for their conjectural ſin of Infant-baptiſm: <hi>will you imagine and ſuppoſe, and dream, and dote, and fancy, and fame a Baptiſm, which the Scriptures and firſt Churches never knew?</hi> For may they not <hi>imagine, &amp;c.</hi> the baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and yet not imagine another <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures know, if Infants be no part of the Ordinance admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto them.

               <p>Again, whereas Mr. <hi>A.</hi> ſaith, that <hi>had infant-baptiſm been an Ordinance of God, the knowledge of it would have been of as great, or greater uſe to the world, then</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer,</p>

               <p>1. That it doth not follow, becauſe the knowledge he ſpeaks of is not given in this place unto the world, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is given no where elſe. Nor 2.

               <p>In the Rear of this his firſt argument (<hi>pag.</hi> 8, 9, &amp;c.) he fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth two objections againſt himſelf, and eſſaieth a ſolution of them reſpectively, but with no better ſucceſſe then ſome novice practitioners in the Black Art, who ſometimes raiſe ſuch ſtubborn ſpirits, which their skill failing them, they are not able to conjure down.

               <p>By the way, this argument with that ſtrength which it hath magnifieth it ſelf every whit as much (if not more) againſt the councel and wiſdome of God in Circumciſion, as againſt his Adverſaries opinion and practice about Infant-Baptiſm. For may it not altogether as rationally, and with as much truth be pleaded and ſaid; that that adminiſtration of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, which was made to profeſſed Beleevers, did more conduce to, and better anſwer the ends of this Ordinance, then that which was made to infants, as it can be pretended, that that adminiſtration of Baptiſm, which he exalteth, more conduceth to, and better anſwers the ends and uſes of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, then that other which he depreſſeth? For (aſſuredly) Circumciſion was in the <hi>ends</hi> and <hi>uſes</hi> of it (at leaſt in the cheif and principal ends and uſes of it) altogether as myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as ſacred and holy, as Baptiſm, yea and very little, if at all, in theſe differing from it.</p>

               <p>That Truth is a ſufferer in this propoſition alſo, is to me ſufficiently evident from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe God himſelf, who (queſtionleſſe) knows much better then Mr. <hi>A.</hi> or any of his judgement, what <hi>adminiſtration</hi> of an Ordinance <hi>moſt conduceth unto, and beſt anſwers the ends of it,</hi> judged the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Circumciſion (an Ordinance of like import with Baptiſm, as ſhall upon occaſion be ſhewed, God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling elſewhere) unto Infants, <hi>more conducing unto, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anſwering the ends</hi> of it (the principal of which was to ſignifie and <hi>ſeal the righteouſneſſe of Faith,</hi> Rom. 4. 11.) then unto Beleevers, or unto perſons of ripe years. Otherwiſe I preſume he would not have ordered the ordinary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant adminiſtration of it unto children, but rather unto men.

If therefore the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Circumciſion made unto Infants under the Law, did as much, or more, <hi>conduce unto the ends</hi> thereof, as this adminiſtration made unto men could have done: in like manner, the adminiſtration of baptiſm made to infants under the Goſpel muſt needs more, or as much, <hi>conduce unto the ends</hi> therof, as it would do, in caſe it were made unto men. They who think, write, or ſay otherwiſe, do they not make themſelves wiſer then God? How, and in what reſpect, one, or more, that adminiſtration of Baptiſm, which we prefer, conduceth as much (or more) to the ends of Baptiſm, as that adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>By the way, the reaſon (I conceive) why <hi>John,</hi> being the meſſenger of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſent before his face to prepare his way [<hi>i. e.</hi> to awaken the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> nation to own and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him, being now come unto them, though as yet they knew it not] <hi>came baptizing with water,</hi> in order to the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation</hi> of him unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> was; becauſe this new un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to baptize, was a proper means to occaſion the generality of this people to inquire more diligently after him (<hi>John</hi> I mean) to examine more narrowly his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and authority by which he did baptize. By means of which inquiry, they came to underſtand that he was a man ſent from God unto them; and conſequently could not but ſo much the more reverence and beleeve the words of his mouth; the firſt born of which was the teſtimony which he gave of their <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as now ready to diſcover himſelf unto ſuch of them, as deſired his comming.</p>
               <p>Upon this account <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>baptizing with water,</hi> might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute towards the manifeſtation of <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and yet the <hi>manifeſtation of Chriſt to the world</hi> be no <hi>end</hi> of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ſimply conſidered, or in its ordinary or ſtanding ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations.</p>

               <p>1. That when and where, the baptizing of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, under the notion of Beleevers, becomes cuſtomary and in faſhion, (which are the terms and ſtate of it amongſt us in theſe daies) the truth is, that there is a very poor and faint viſibility of any mans Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or Repentance, in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:118706:138"/> their willing ſubjection unto that Ordinance. When <hi>all the land of Judea, and they of Jeruſalem, and all the Region round about Jordan,</hi> went out unto <hi>John</hi> to be baptized of him, and were baptized accordingly, what exemplarineſſe was there in any particular mans ſubjection unto this Ordinance? or what viſibility of any mans faith or repentance, whereas <hi>John</hi> himſelf, notwithſtanding this voluntary offering themſelves unto Baptiſm, called them a <hi>generation of vipers,</hi> (Luke 3. 7.) and complaining of the unbeleef of the generality of them, ſaith; <hi>And what he hath ſeen and heard that he teſtifieth, and NO MAN receiveth his teſtimony?</hi> John 3. 32. Yea many of thoſe who willingly offered themſelves unto Baptiſm (yea, and were immediately after baptized of him, were ſo far from beleeving in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that they were doubtfull whether <hi>John</hi> himſelf was not the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Luke 3. 15. Therefore there is no ſuch viſibility of Faith or Repentance in any mans offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf unto Baptiſm, or in his being baptized, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally under ſuch a circumſtance, as that mentioned.

               <p>3. When the Infants of Beleevers are baptized, there may be (and haply ought to be) the ſame <hi>Chriſtian</hi> actings and deportments in every kind, in the Parents, or thoſe who offer them unto baptiſm. So that <hi>the Spectators,</hi> may by means, or by occaſion of their baptizing alſo, be as much inſtructed, edified, quickned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they can or could be, by the baptizing of theſe Parents themſelves. He that offereth his child to be baptized in the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hereby maketh as ſolemn as ſerious a profeſſion of his faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo of his Repentance, as he could do by being baptized himſelf. So that <hi>Spectators</hi> are no whit greater gainers by Beleevers-baptiſm, then by infant-baptiſm. Nay the truth is, that they are, or may be, greater gainers by the latter. For when a Beleever having been himſelf formerly baptized, ſhall offer his Child alſo unto Baptiſm, this argueth a greater ſtability and triedneſſe of faith in him, then his offering himſelf unto Baptiſm doth, who newly beleeveth. A teſtimony given up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and after, a thorough experience, is (<hi>coeteris paribus</hi>) more authoritative and convincing, then that which is given upon little or no trial. Yea the baptizing of Infants muſt needs in this reſpect turn to a better account unto <hi>Spectators</hi> (if by <hi>Spectators,</hi> we mean, either the Church, or the world, who may as well the one as the other, if they pleaſe, and have opportunity, be preſent at any kind of baptizing) then the baptizing of Beleevers; becauſe if Beleevers onely be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, the occaſions and opportunities of all baptiſmal edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation are like to be fewer by many, then they would be, in caſe Infant-baptiſm were generally practiſed. For many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are taken away by death in their infancy, and ſo never come to be Beleevers (in Mr. <hi>A</hi>'s ſence) in which caſe, if
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:118706:139"/> they be not baptized, all thoſe opportunities of Baptiſmal edification are loſt, which might have been taken and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improved, by their baptizing. I take no notice of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Scriptural notion, upon which he argueth all along this part of his diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that Infants and Beleevers are two contra-diſtinct, or oppoſite <hi>species</hi> of men. We may have occaſion to touch this hereafter.</p>
               <p>Onely by the way I cannot but a little marvell, why Mr. <hi>A.</hi> ſhould aſcribe unto his baptiſm of Beleevers, ſuch great matters of edification in reſpect of <hi>Spectators,</hi> when as (as far as I can yet underſtand) the practitioners of this Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm ſeek and take, both times and places of greateſt privacy for the adminiſtration and practice of it. But the very truth is, that Mr. <hi>A.</hi> doth but meerly trifle in all that long-ſome diſcourſe (<hi>pag. 12, 13, 14, &amp;c.</hi>) wherein he builds upon this ſuppoſition (formerly detected of the crime of vanity) that <hi>One end of Baptiſm is the manifestation of Christ unto the world.</hi> But</p>

A little after, he ſtumbles at the ſame ſtone, of miſ-alledging the text (whether wittingly, or at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, let the reader judge) where pretending to repreſent the <hi>ſin of the Prieſts and Elders, in oppoſition to the Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of the Publicans and Harlots, viſible</hi> (as he ſaith, but untruly as hath been ſhewed) <hi>in their baptiſm,</hi> in the words of <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 30. he ſaith it was their <hi>rejecting the counſel of God againſt themſelves, IN not being baptized;</hi> whereas (as was now ſaid) there is not the leaſt appearance of the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>IN,</hi> either in the original, or tranſlation. The ſence and import of the place, is plainly, and without parable, this; that the Prieſts and Elders in refuſing the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> hereby diſcovered the prodigious folly, and wickedneſſe of their hearts, in <hi>rejecting</hi> the counſel of God concerning their juſtification and ſalvation by Faith in the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whom <hi>John</hi> preached, and this with ſo much the more authority and advantage to have been beleeved in his Teſtimony or Doctrine concerning him, becauſe he was extraordinarily raiſed up and ſent by God to adminiſter a new Ordinance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. The meaning is not, as if that <hi>counſel of God,</hi> which they are here ſaid to have <hi>rejected against themſelves,</hi> conſiſted in this, that he would have had them baptized by <hi>John;</hi> but in this, that he had purpoſed to juſtifie and ſave them by Faith in his ſon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This was the great and bleſſed <hi>counſel of God,</hi> which they rejected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> [fruſtrated, or made void] againſt themſelves, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the depriving of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the two great bleſſings, juſtification by the way, and ſalvation in the end. Concerning their not being baptized by <hi>John,</hi> had they otherwiſe beleeved in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> this could
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:118706:140"/> have turned to no ſuch great prejudice unto them. Nor was it the <hi>counſel of God,</hi> that either they, or any other ſort of men, ſhould be baptized of <hi>John</hi> by way of neceſſity, either to their juſtification, or ſalvation. For if ſo, then all thoſe who were not baptized by <hi>John,</hi> although afterwards bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his Diſciples, muſt be ſuppoſed to have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed eternally. But certain it is, that all thoſe who reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>counſel of God,</hi> and continued in this rejection, which the Prieſts and Elders are here ſaid to have <hi>rejected againſt themſelves</hi> (eſpecially having like means with them to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it) did periſh eternally. Therefore nothing can be more plain, then that they ſit down quite beſides the mind of the Holy Ghoſt in this text of Scripture, who conceive the <hi>counſel</hi> of God here mentioned, to reſpect <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſm, or any mans being baptized by him.</p>

               <p>Beſides the preſent unbeleef, and wicked frame of heart, of the Preiſts and Elders conſidered, they did not ſo much as ſin in not coming to <hi>John</hi> to be baptized; as Turks and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels during their infidelity, do not ſin, in not offering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves either to Baptiſm, or to the Lords Table, among <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> albeit it is true, that they ſin in neglecting to put themſelves into a regular capacity of offering themſelves both to the one and the other. Therefore certainly it was not the <hi>counſel of God,</hi> that the Prieſts and Elders, under that irregularity of heart, which they had at preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, ſhould have heen baptized by <hi>John,</hi> inasmuch as this had been a manifeſt prophanation in them of this great Ordinance; although I do not conceive that <hi>John</hi> had ſinned in baptizing them, in caſe they had deſired it of him. Nor is it any part of the <hi>counſel of God,</hi> that men ſhould ſin or act any thing to their own condemnation. The reſult of the late premiſes, is, that the ſin of the Prieſts and Elders in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the <hi>counſel of God;</hi> [ſo termed in the words before us] <hi>againſt themſelves,</hi> did not conſiſt in their not being baptized by <hi>John,</hi> but in rejecting their <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſent unto them: and that their refuſal of being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by <hi>John,</hi> having been invited and exhorted unto Faith
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:118706:141"/> and Repentance by his miniſtry, was a ſign or evidence of this their rejection. Nor doth it follow, that in caſe their refuſing Baptiſm at the hand of <hi>John,</hi> plainly argued their unbeleef; therefore the accepting of baptiſm from him did in like manner argue the Faith and Repentance of all thoſe who accepted it. <hi>A remotione unius contrarij ad poſition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1.

And if <hi>Abraham's RECEIVING</hi> Circumciſion in this place, ſignified his being circumciſed in the fleſh, it muſt follow, that all his poſterity, <hi>receiving</hi> circumciſion in this ſenſe, as well as he, ſhould at leaſt in part, all of them <hi>be Fathers of them that believe as well as he;</hi> in as much as this prerogative is manifeſtly by the Apoſtles ſuſpended upon that <hi>receiving</hi> of Circumciſion, which is here ſpoken of, not upon the end, for which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:118706:144"/> dwelt firſt in his Grandmother Loïs [2 Tim. 1. 5.]</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ſame ſpecies or kind of Faith, i.

               <p n="3">3. For the cleare underſtanding the Scripture before us, it is diligently to be obſerved, that the Apoſtle doth not ſay, <hi>that Abraham received circumciſion</hi> as either <hi>ſign,</hi> or <hi>ſeal</hi> of his Faith, but, <hi>of the righteouſneſſe of the Faith, which he had,</hi> i. of that juſtification, or juſtified eſtate, wherein by vertue of the counſell, will, and decree of God in that behalf, he was inveſted or inſtated, by, and upon, his beleving. Circumciſion was neither <hi>ſign,</hi> nor <hi>ſeal,</hi> of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, nor of any other mans Faith how like ſoever unto <hi>Abraham's,</hi> but <hi>of the righteouſnes of his Faith;</hi> yet not as his, but as true, and <hi>unfeigned,</hi> 1. ſuch, as unto which God by covenant and promiſe, had annexed the Grace and bleſſedneſſe of Juſtification. From whence it follow's,</p>
               <p n="4">4. That circumciſion could not be a <hi>ſign</hi> or <hi>ſeal</hi> of the <hi>righteouſneſſe of Abrahams Faith</hi> only, individually or perſonally conſidered; but muſt needs be this <hi>ſign</hi> and <hi>ſeal</hi> of the ſame righteouſneſſe of the like Faith, in what perſon, or perſons ſoever it ſhould be found. Yea it was a <hi>ſign</hi> and <hi>ſeal</hi> of the <hi>righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> ſimply and indefinitely conſidered, i. as promiſed or covenanted by God unto man-kind. So that whether any perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews</hi> had been circumciſed, or not, and ſo whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any circumciſed perſon had beleeved, or not, yet was Circumciſion a <hi>ſign and ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of Faith</hi> unto them, as well as unto thoſe, who were both circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and believed. i. As God made this covenant with the world, or man-kind in generall, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truly believed in him, ſhould hereby become righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:118706:144"/> or (which is the ſame) be juſtified; ſo likewiſe upon the ſame generall and unlimited terms, he gave the Ordinance of circumciſion (by the hand or miniſterie of his ſervant <hi>Abraham</hi>) for a <hi>ſign</hi> and <hi>ſeal</hi> of his truth and faithfulneſſe in this covenant [i. that he would juſtifie all thoſe without exception who ſhould truly beleeve] This is evident from theſe words [in the fall of the verſe] in their dependance upon the former; <hi>that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs might be imputed unto them alſo [unto them,</hi> i. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all] <hi>that ſhould believe</hi> [whether circumciſed, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed] as if he ſhould have ſaid; Therefore <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham received the ſign of circumciſion, a ſeal of the righteouſnes of that</hi> kind of <hi>Faith, which he had being yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſed,</hi> that ſo all thoſe without exception, who ſhould <hi>beleeve</hi> as he did, might have the ſame aſſurance with him, that <hi>righteouſneſſe ſhould be imputed unto them alſo,</hi> as it had been unto him, i. that they ſhould be as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly juſtified by God, as he had been. Mr. <hi>Fiſhers</hi> notion, denying Circumciſion of old, and Baptiſm now, to be any <hi>ſign</hi> at all unto children, is very childiſh, and unworthy a Conſidering man. Circumciſion was the ſame, i. the ſame <hi>ſign,</hi> unto children, which it was unto men: nor was there any difference, change, or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it, or in the ſignifying nature or propertie of it, when it was actually apprehended and underſtood by theſe children being now become men. But the preſent inability or incapacity in children to underſtand the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage or ſignification of a ſign, doth not prove that that which is really a ſign, is no ſign unto them: it onely proves, that it is not apprehended as a ſign, or in the ſignifying relation of it, by them. If ſigns be no ſigns unto children, becauſe they do not at preſent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their ſignification, it will follow, that there are none at all in the world unto men, whilſt they are aſleep, or whilſt thorow any ingagement of their minds or thoughts otherwiſe, they do not actually mind or attend the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of them. A ſign is not therefore called a ſign, becauſe it alwayes actually ſignifies one thing, or other,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:118706:145"/> unto any man, but becauſe it is apt to ſignifie ſuch or ſuch a thing, unto thoſe that are in a capacitie (whether more immediate, or more remote) to underſtand it, and withall, actually mind the ſignification. But the conceit we now ſpeak of is ſo wateriſh, that there is no taſt either of truth, or reaſon in it.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Nor is Mr. <hi>A.</hi> a friend either unto reaſon, or to the truth, in affirming, that <hi>there is no capacitie in children of performing that, to which they do ingage.</hi> For, 1. in ſuch a ſenſe as there is a <hi>capacitie</hi> in them to <hi>engage</hi> unto any thing, there is likewiſe to <hi>perform.</hi> Children are in as good and proper a <hi>capacitie</hi> to <hi>perform</hi> that, which is or ought to be <hi>ingaged</hi> unto in Baptim, as to make the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement it ſelf.

They who as yet doubted whether <hi>John</hi> was the Meſſiah, or no, were not in a preſent or immediate <hi>capacitie</hi> of beeleeving <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be this Meſſiah; yet were they ingaged by their being baptized to beleeve this; and notwithſtanding their
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:118706:148"/> actuall incapacitie of beleeving it, were lawfully bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.

Yea Mr. <hi>A.</hi> himſelf by being baptized, <hi>ingaged</hi> to a perſeverance in Faith and holineſſe unto the end of his dayes; yet was he not at the time of his baptiſm in an actuall <hi>capacitie</hi> to <hi>perform</hi> that, which he <hi>engaged</hi> unto in this kind. For a preſent ſtanding in Grace, or Faith, is no more an actuall <hi>capacitie</hi> of perſevering in either to the end of a mans life, then a preſent healthfull ſtate or condition of the body is an actuall capacitie of preſerving himſelf in health untill he dieth; or then the preſent poſſeſſion of an eſtate worth 1000. l. <hi>per annum,</hi> is <hi>an</hi> actuall capacitie in the poſſeſſor of paying a debt of a 1000. or 2000 l. twenty years after.

The reaſon of this conſequence is plain; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe a Declaration of a mans Repentance by theſe, or any of them, is not required by God, nor yet accepted by him, upon any ſuch account, as to intereſſe him in remiſſion of ſins, or to tranſlate him from an eſtate of ſin and death, into a ſtate of juſtification; no, nor yet to intitle him to the ſanctification of the Spirit. For he that is not a juſtified perſon before any Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be made by him of his repentance, by ſuch fruits or expreſſions of it, as theſe, will never be juſtified after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.

For there is nothing more certain then that many, who have truly repented, want faith to beleeve that Mr. <hi>A's</hi> Baptiſm is ſo much as lawfull for them to ſubmit unto.

The prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart for the performance of a duty, when opportunitie ſerveth and requireth it, as well as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance it ſelf, is oft in Scripture injoyned in ſuch terms or words, which properly ſignifie the Act, or performance it ſelf.

               <p>True it is, that if we ſpeak of perſons living to years of diſcretion, and under the miniſterie of the Goſpell, they muſt be <hi>baptized</hi> in one kind or other, either with a <hi>baptiſm</hi> literally and properly ſo called (I mean, a <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> with water) or elſe with a <hi>Baptiſm</hi> vertually, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalently, ſo called.

               <p>If it be yet replied; but is it not evident that <hi>Peter</hi> here ſpake of water-baptiſm it ſelf, and that he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to be <hi>baptized</hi> herewith, as well as to <hi>repent,</hi> for the <hi>remiſſion of ſins?</hi> And was it not in obedience to this his exhortation, or command, that they were according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (many of them) <hi>baptized</hi> with water-baptiſm, v. 41. I anſwer,</p>
               <p>Be it granted that he ſpeaks of water-baptiſm, yet it muſt be granted withall, that he exhorteth no man to be <hi>baptized</hi> herewith, but upon this ſuppoſition, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, that they ſhould be every wayes and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of all circumſtances, ſatisfied in their judgements and conſciences touching the lawfulneſſe of their act, in yielding themſelves to be baptized in this kind. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Baptiſm, which we ſpeak of and allow, <hi>viz.</hi> a readineſſe and willingneſſe of mind to be baptized with water, when we are ſatisfied touching the will of God concerning us in that behalf, and otherwiſe have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of a like ſatisfaction in all points unto us, for the actuall reception of it, is the <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> unto which eſpecially, and in the firſt place, <hi>Peter</hi> (in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before us) exhorteth men ſin his exhortation unto them to <hi>be baptized.</hi> Otherwiſe we muſt make the ſence and meaning of this his exhortation, to riſe thus; Be ye <hi>baptized,</hi> whether you be convinced of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie,

               <p>If it be yet ſaid, that it is no waies probable that <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf had any other meaning in his words, when he commanded them to be <hi>Baptized,</hi> but ſimply and plainly, that he would have them forthwith to be water-baptized, and conſequently that he had no thought of any ſuch Baptiſm (eminently, or vertually ſo called) which you put upon him.

               <p>That it is ſomewhat, yea much more then probable, that though <hi>Peter</hi> did not formally or explicitly mean any thing more in the words in queſtion, then what the

The reaſon is evident, becauſe had he not ſuppoſed them, either already ſatisfied before his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation directed unto them, or at leaſt that they would be ſatisfied by it, that it was the will of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> that they ſhould be Water-baptized, and that there was an opportunitie before them every wayes le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate for their reception of this Baptiſm, he would in the firſt place rather have endeavoured to ſatisfie them, that this was the will and pleaſure of <hi>Chriſt</hi> concerning them, and that the opportunitie before them for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Baptiſm was every wayes legitimate, and approve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, then have either commanded, or exhorted them to be preſently baptized.</p>

God may upon ſome particular occaſion, under ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, require ſuch or ſuch a thing of ſome men, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their obtaining ſuch or ſuch a benefit, or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, without ſubjecting all men without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in all caſes, to a neceſſitie of uſing the ſame means for obtaining that ſame or like end; eſpecially when he hath no where declared himſelf to ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, yea and much more, when he hath declined all declaration of himſelf in ſuch a way, even when he had an opportunitie inviting him to ſuch a declaration, in caſe he had been in any degree diſpoſed to it.

               <p n="1">1. It is none of the beſt adviſed, ſayings in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, to ſay, that the promiſe of remiſſion of ſins, and gift of the Spirit, was <hi>made upon condition of Faith and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:118706:171"/> Baptiſm.</hi> God is not wont to <hi>make</hi> his promiſes upon any condition, or conditions whatſoever, but freely, and of himſelf. Only he makes many of them of ſuch a tenor or form, wherein the performance of them, or the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all exhibition of the good things promiſed, is ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the performance of a condition, one or more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither can Mr. <hi>A.</hi> ſhew us, where God ever made any promiſe of remiſſion of ſins, and gift of the Spirit, upon condition of Repentance and Baptiſm [I mean, of giving remiſſion of ſins, and the ſpirit, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe conditions] at leaſt any promiſe with exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thoſe from theſe priviledges, who ſhall not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form both theſe conditions.

               <p n="3">3. (And laſtly for this) the <hi>promiſe</hi> which <hi>Peter</hi> here ſaith was <hi>to them, and to their children, and to all thoſe that are afarre off, even as many, &amp;c.</hi> is a great and generall promiſe of life and Salvation, and conſequently of all things neceſſarie hereunto, as forgiveneſſe of ſins, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification by the Spirit, &amp;c. which God hath made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all mankind; but with this <hi>proviſo,</hi> or clauſe of excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they only ſhall partake of the good things of this <hi>promiſe,</hi> not who ſhall be baptized, but who ſhall truly repent and believe in him. For evident it is that the <hi>promiſe</hi> aſſerted by the Apoſtle in this place to the <hi>Jews, their children, to all thoſe afarre off, &amp;c.</hi> was delivered by God long before now, even under the old Teſtament, where there is frequent mention made of Faith and repentance, and of Gods requiring theſe of men to render them capable of bleſſedneſſe from him; but there is <hi>altum ſilentium,</hi> profound ſilence all along, and not a word ſpoken of Baptiſm. <hi>To him</hi> (ſaith <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Act. 10. 43.) <hi>give all the Prophets witneſſes that thorow his name whoſoever believeth in him ſhall receive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins.</hi> So that the performance of the ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:118706:171"/> could not be ſuſpended by God, either in whole, or in part, upon Baptiſm. For as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth for juſtification by faith in the promiſe of Grace, againſt juſtification by the Law, which was not given untill a long time after the ſaid promiſe, <hi>And this I ſay, that the Covenant that was confirmed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of God in Chriſt, the Law which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot diſanull, that it ſhould make the promiſe of none effect, (Gal.</hi> 3. 17.) ſo may we argue the caſe in hand; the Law of Baptiſm, which was given many hundred years after the promiſe of life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto thoſe that ſhould repent and believe, cannot diſanull this promiſe; which notwithſtanding it ſhould do, if the ſaid terms or qualifications of Repentance and Faith could not intereſſe men in the ſaid promiſe; (I mean, in the good things promiſed) without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
               <p>That clauſe in the latter end of ver. 39. <hi>even as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as the Lord our God ſhall call</hi> (to adde this by the way) is not ſo much, (nor indeed, at all) reſtrictive, but encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging and extenſive; importing, that no perſon, or perſons whatſoever, to whom the word of promiſe, or the Goſpell, ſhall come, need be at all troubled, or afraid, that though they ſhould repent, yet they ſhould not partake of the good things promiſed, in as much as the promiſes, be they never ſo many, be they the whole world, is comprehenſive of them all. But about this (I ſuppoſe) there is no difference between Mr. <hi>A.</hi> and me.</p>
               <p>5. When two ſeverall means (as here, <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>being baptized</hi>) are preſcribed in order to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of ſuch or ſuch an end (as the ſaid two means here are ſpoken of, be, in order to <hi>remiſſion of ſins</hi>) it doth not preſently follow, that both theſe means, no nor yet that either of them, are ſimply, abſolutely, or univerſally neceſſary to the obtaining of this end; or that this end is not attainable by any other means what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, in caſe either of theſe, yea or both of them,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:118706:172"/> be wanting; eſpecially when one of them is but of an inferiour import, and hath neither in the nature of it, nor by any inſtitution from God, any eſſentiall or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable connexion with this end; leaſt of all doth ſuch a thing follow, either when a third means of a rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and fuller contribution towards the ſaid end, ſhall be uſed in ſtead of this latter, or when the end is elſewhere declared by God himſelf, to be attainable, yea and that it ſhall certainly be obtained, by the former means alone; as remiſſion of ſins is oft in ſcripture ſecured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Repentance, where there is not the leaſt whiſper of any neceſſitie of Water-baptiſm to be joyned with it to render it effectuall in this kind. See <hi>Act. 3. 19. 2 Pet. 3. 9. Luk. 15. 7, 10. Luk. 24. 47. Act.</hi> 11. 18.

So when writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he ſaith, that <hi>they may ALL propheſie one by one, that ALL may learn, and ALL may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 31.</note> it cannot reaſonably be inferred from hence, that unleſſe they did <hi>ALL</hi> (underſtand we it, <hi>ALL</hi> that had the gift of prophecying amongſt theſe) <hi>propheſie one by one, ALL</hi> [i. the whole body of the Church, and every member of it] could not posſibly <hi>learn, or be comforted.</hi> For certain it is, that all might have <hi>learned,</hi> &amp; ſo have been <hi>comforted,</hi> although only ſome few of the prophets amogſt them had prophecied. So when it is ſaid, <hi>John did baptize in the wilderneſſe, &amp; preach the Baptiſm of repentance FOR the remiſſion of ſins</hi> (Mar. 1. 4.) it cannot be concluded from hence, that therefore without <hi>Johns</hi> preaching, there could be, or have been, no remisſion of ſins. Therefore the preſcribing of Baptiſm together with Repentance, for <hi>remiſſion of ſins,</hi> doth not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſuppoſe, that without Baptiſm Remisſion of ſins can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attained.</p>

               <p>Laſtly (for this) ſuppoſe we that Mr. <hi>A's</hi> conceit about the meaning of the ſaid Scripture, ſhould (againſt Scripture light) be admitted, yet would neither his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-paedo-baptiſmall conceit, nor his conceit about the neceſſitie of water-dipping, receive any incouragement, or credit at all hereby. Not the latter, becauſe here is only mention made of being <hi>baptized;</hi> nothing at all ſo much as hinted at the greateſt diſtance, touching the neceſſitie of any determinate manner of the performance or reception of it. Nor yet the former; becauſe, 1. from the order of the two duties, as they are here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt and named, firſt, <hi>Repentance,</hi> and then being <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,</hi> nothing can be concluded for an univerſall neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of the one to precede the other in time, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarce any thing of more common obſervation in the Scriptures, then that the order of things, as well that of time, as of nature, is here frequently interchanged, and that mentioned in the firſt place, which in reſpect
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:118706:174"/> of Order, as well the one, as the other, is latter. <hi>Joh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 5. Water</hi> (which Mr. <hi>A.</hi> underſtands of Baptiſmall wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) is mentioned before the <hi>Spirit,</hi> in the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. <hi>Baptizing (Mat.</hi> 3. 6.) is mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>confeſſing of ſins,</hi> yea and ver. 11.) before repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. <hi>Confeſſion with the mouth (Rom.</hi> 10. 9.) is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before <hi>beleeving with the heart.</hi> So the <hi>Greek</hi> is mentioned before the <hi>Jew, Coloſ.</hi> 3. 11. as the <hi>Jew</hi> before the <hi>Greek, Gal.</hi> 3. 28. So again, <hi>joy</hi> is mentioned before <hi>peace, Gal.</hi> 5. 22. and yet <hi>peace</hi> before <hi>joy, Rom. 14. 17. Melchizedeck's</hi> act in bleſſing <hi>Abraham,</hi> is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the firſt place, and his bleſſing the God of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> in the latter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 19, 20. So likewiſe, the <hi>burnt-offering</hi> is named before the <hi>ſin-offering,</hi> Levit. 12. 8. whereas the <hi>ſin-offering</hi> was in order of time to go before it, as appears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Levit.</hi> 8. 14, 18. and ſo again, <hi>Levit.</hi> 9. 7, &amp;c. It were eaſie to multiplie inſtances in this kind, I mean both where there is an interchangable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the ſame things in reſpect of prioritie and poſterioritie; as likewiſe where that which precedes in time, is mentioned after that, which in time comes behind it. Therefore from the Order in <hi>Peters</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation between <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> nothing can be argued to prove a neceſſitie, that Repentance alwayes ought, in reſpect of time, to precede Baptiſm; as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did it precede in the Baptiſm, of which notice was taken formerly.</p>
               <p>2. In caſe it were granted, that from the Scripture yet on the ſtage, it could be proved (yea, or were ſo evident, as Mr. <hi>A.</hi> gloryingly over his adverſaries, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth) that <hi>remiſſion of ſins</hi> dependeth in part upon Baptiſm, and that neither Faith, Repentance, Love, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Self-deniall, Mortification, with all the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retinew of the Graces of the Spirit, can do any thing to the <hi>intereſſing</hi> men in this priviledge, but only in conjunction with Baptiſm, yet neither from hence will it follow, that therefore Infant-baptiſm is unlawfull, yea, or not as available in this kind, as Mr. <hi>A's</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:118706:175"/> is. Evident it is that there is no rational footing for either of theſe inferences in either of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. For the lawfulneſſe of Infant-baptiſm ſuppoſed, the contrary whereof (as we even now demonſtrated) cannot be proved from the Scripture in hand, there can be no reaſon to diſ-intereſſe it in any priviledge, or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, which is veſted in any Water-baptiſm whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>

               <p>Thus at laſt we ſee as by a noon-day light, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly, and upon how ſlight grounds, Mr. <hi>A.</hi> hath fallen un-Chriſtianly foul and heavie upon his Chriſtian Brethren diſſenting from him in his ſence about Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, by adjudging the caſe againſt them, thus: <hi>It is too e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be denied by any, but thoſe that wil not ſee,</hi> from Act. 2. 38, 39. <hi>That both Repentance, and the Declaration of it by Baptiſm, is required on mans part to intereſſe him in remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins, &amp; ſanctification of the ſpirit.</hi> And as touching this latter, <hi>the Sanctification of the Spirit,</hi> that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is not neceſſarily, or univerſally required on mans part, <hi>to intereſs him</hi> herein, is of much more eaſie demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then the former. But enough upon this account hath been ſaid formerly, conſidering how point-blank the Scripture lieth in many places againſt this conceit. Review the eighth Section of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Although Mr. <hi>A.</hi> (for cauſe beſt known to himſelf) waves the impanelling of <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 16. to ſerve upon his Jurie as hath been formerly noted) yet becauſe <hi>Gehezi</hi> thinks himſelf wiſer at this turn, then his Maſter, and will not loſe the opportunitie and advantage (ſo ſeeming to him) of ſuch a Scripture, though the other letteth it paſſe, let us beſtow a few lines in the examination of it alſo. The words are theſe: <hi>And now why tarrieſt thou? ariſe, and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the Name of the Lord. Paul</hi> himſelf reporteth theſe words as ſpoken unto him by <hi>Ananias,</hi> upon his ſight reſtored, of which he had been for a ſeaſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:118706:175"/> by means of the glory of that light, wherein the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> had appeared unto him from heaven, as he was journeying towards <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> Now becauſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi> expreſſeth himſelf unto <hi>Paul,</hi> thus,—<hi>be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and waſh away thy ſins,</hi> ſome (according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Mr. <hi>A's</hi> Doctrine) inferre, that therefore Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm waſheth away ſinnes, i. procureth Juſtification, or pardon of ſinne, in the ſight of God. But to this we anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Subſtantiall proof hath been made, and this by many arguments, that remiſſion of ſinnes is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, or procurement, of the blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and is obtained, or received, by ſuch a Faith, which is accompanied with a true Repentance: and that it is not ſuſpended either in whole or in part, upon Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Evident it is that <hi>Paul,</hi> when, and before, the words in hand were ſpoken unto him by <hi>Ananias,</hi> was in an eſtate of Juſtification before God, and had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a remiſſion of all his ſins. For 1. <hi>Ananias</hi> ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him, <hi>BROTHER Saul, (Act.</hi> 22. 13.) before he baptized him: which (doubtleſſe) had he judged him to be in an eſtate of Reprobation, he would not have done. 2. He <hi>prayed,</hi> and this with acceptation in the ſight of God, before he was baptized (<hi>Act.</hi> 9. 11.) This alſo evinceth him to have been in favour with God before his ſaid baptizing, and conſequently that his ſinnes were forgiven him. 3. When <hi>Ananias</hi> replied unto the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaking unto him in a viſion, and injoyning him to ſeek out <hi>Paul,</hi> that he had <hi>heard by many how much evill he had done to the Saints at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> the Lord made him this anſwer; <hi>Go thy way: for he is a choſen veſſell unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and the children of Iſrael. For I will ſhew him how great things he muſt ſuffer for my Names ſake, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe things ſufficiently declare him to have been in favour with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whilſt he was yet unbapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; and ſo not to have been in a ſtate of condemnation,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:118706:176"/> or under the guilt of his ſinnes, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that his ſinnes were not for given him, either by means of, or upon, his baptizing. 4. The Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> had in a moſt extraordinarie and glorious manner revealed himſelf from heaven unto him, telling him plainly, that he <hi>was Jeſus whom he perſecuted;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him accordingly. <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 5, 6. Therefore (certainly) by this time he was in a ſtate of acceptation with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo cleanſed from his ſins. 5. (And laſtly) if his ſins were in any ſuch way, or ſence, <hi>waſhed away,</hi> in, or by his Baptiſm, as if untill now he had been in a ſtate of wrath thorow a retainment or non-forgiveneſſe of his ſinnes by God, then had <hi>Ananias</hi> admitted an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean perſon, and a child of <hi>Sathan,</hi> unto Baptiſm, when he admitted <hi>Paul:</hi> and conſequently neither Faith, nor Repentance, nor yet the profeſſion of either, ſhall be neceſſarie to qualifie for Baptiſm, unleſſe it be ſaid that <hi>Ananias</hi> acted contrary to Goſpell rule in baptizing <hi>Paul.</hi> Therefore (certainly) <hi>Ananias</hi> his meaning, in ſaying unto him, <hi>Ariſe, and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins, &amp;c.</hi> was not that by being baptized he ſhould be juſtified in the ſight of God, or obtain the pardon and forgiveneſſe of his ſins (Theſe, as hath been proved, having been forgiven him before his baptizing) but that either, 1. he ſhould waſh away his ſins, Typically, or Sacramentally; or elſe (and rather) 2. that upon his being baptized, he ſhould <hi>waſh away his ſinnes,</hi> i. (in his own expreſſion and phraſe) <hi>cleanſe</hi> himſelf <hi>from all filthineſſe both of Fleſh and Spirit,</hi> ſerving God in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and true holineſſe all the dayes of his life. So that theſe words, and <hi>waſh away thy ſinnes,</hi> do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, or relate unto, matter of juſtification, but of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</p>
               <p>This latter Interpretation might be abetted by the enlargment and preſſing of theſe, and ſuch like conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Men are no where in Scripture commanded to juſtifie themſelves, at leaſt not in that ſence, wherein ſome Anabaptiſts interpret the words in hand, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:118706:176"/> which we now argue) but frequently to ſanctifie themſelves. See <hi>Levit. 11. 44. Levit. 20. 7. Joel 3. 5. 2 Chron.</hi> 29. 5. (to omit other places.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. The work, or duty of Sanctification, is often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the Metaphor of <hi>waſhing, Waſh you, make you clean: put away the evill of your doings, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 1. 16. <hi>O Jeruſalem, waſh thine heart from wickedneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 4. 14. <hi>But ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It hath been proved, that <hi>Paul</hi> before his bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, was in a juſtified condition; and conſequently, could not be exhorted by Baptiſm to <hi>waſh away his ſinnes</hi> in any ſuch ſence, which importeth Juſtification, or remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſence we now plead of the words, <hi>and waſh away thy ſins,</hi> well accommodates both the former, and the latter part of the verſe; whereas the ſence oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, falleth in kindly with neither. For the former, thus: <hi>Be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins,</hi>] i. <hi>be baptized,</hi> and then be carefull to obſerve the holy ingagement, which thy ſubmiſſion unto Baptiſm impoſeth on thee. For the latter, thus: <hi>Waſh away thy ſinnes, calling upon the Name of the Lord</hi>] 1. Caſt away from thee the evill of thy wayes, depart from iniquitie, ſo ſhall thou call upon the Name of God, or of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (as ſome expound the word, <hi>Lord</hi>) with acceptation; according to that 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. (as the <hi>Geneva</hi> Tranſlation readeth it) <hi>Let every one that calleth on the Name of Chriſt, depart from iniquitie.</hi> Whereas on the other hand, to make <hi>Ananias</hi> to ſpeak unto <hi>Paul,</hi> thus: <hi>Ariſe, and be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Allthough I rather incline to the interpretation of the place now aſſerted, yet the other, which underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Ananias</hi> to ſpeak of a Typicall <hi>waſhing away of ſinne</hi> by Baptiſm, is probable, and of good accord with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture notion, and Phraſe. This interpretation ſuppoſeth <hi>Ananias</hi> ſpeaking unto <hi>Paul</hi> to this effect. <hi>Ariſe, be
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:118706:177"/> baptized, and waſh away thy ſinnes, &amp;c. q. d.</hi> The Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath appeared from Heaven unto thee, he hath prevailed with thee to believe on him to the juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy perſon, and forgiveneſſe of thy ſins. Why then ſhouldeſt thou delay the receiving of the ſeal or confirmation of this thy bleſſedneſſe, and not make haſt to be baptized, ſeeing Baptiſm is a Type or Figure of an Heavenly inſtitution, wherein the waſhing or cleanſing of the conſcience from the guilt and defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinne, is ſhadowed, and Typically, or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally tranſacted. In Scripture, things are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to be done, ſimply, and without explication, when they are done only in their Type, or Sacramental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Thus <hi>Ezekiel</hi> calleth his declaring the deſtruction of the citie, the <hi>deſtroying</hi> of it, ſimply; <hi>When I came to deſtroy the citie, Ezek.</hi> 43. 3. So likewiſe he is ſaid to <hi>bear the iniquitie of the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>ſo to lay ſiege againſt it, &amp;c, (Ezek.</hi> 4. 3. 5.) when as he did theſe but in Type and figure only. <hi>Therefore WE ARE B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIED with him by,</hi> or through <hi>Baptiſm, &amp;c. Rom. 6. 4. i.</hi> we are Typically, or Sacramentally <hi>buried with him, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Col. 2. 12. buried with him in Baptiſm.</hi> Thus 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 21. The figure of Baptiſm</hi> is ſaid <hi>to ſave men</hi> (of which formerly, <hi>viz.</hi> Sect. 130.) In this kind of Dialect likewiſe the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Galathians,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt was crucified among them,</hi> [meaning, Sacramental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or repreſentatively only] <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. (to omit many the like) I finde our Proteſtant Expoſitours more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally leaning rather to this interpretation, then the other. <hi>Water</hi> (ſaith <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Another excellent effect, and uſe of Baptiſm is, thereby to juſtifie God in the ſight of the world, as touching the truth of his ſayings in the Goſpell, for ſo it is ſaid,</hi> Luk. 7. 29. <hi>That all the people that heard him, juſtified God, being Baptized with the Baptiſm of Iohn.</hi> And ſoon after:

                  <hi>They are ſaid to juſtifie God in being Baptized, becauſe by their voluntarie ſubmiſſion unto that Ordinance, they did declare, that they judged the Doctrine and Precepts of the Goſpell, of which Baptiſm is a part, moſt worthy belief and obedience, as coming from God. But inaſmuch as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are only paſſive in Baptiſm, and not active or volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, they cannot contribute any thing towards the juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is the cauſe of Infant-baptiſm like to ſuffer by any thing that is ſaid here. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>juſtification of God in the ſight of the world,</hi> is no <hi>effect of Baptiſm;</hi> eſpecially not as taken up, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by Mr. <hi>A.</hi> &amp; moſt of his way. For how can God be <hi>juſtified in the ſight of the world,</hi> by any ſuch tranſaction of men, which is tranſacted by them out of the ſight, view, and cogniſance <hi>of the world?</hi> And we have oft had occaſion to conſider, that moſt of thoſe baptiſmall tranſactions, which are practiſed in Mr. <hi>A's</hi> way of Baptizing, are wont to be, little other then clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine, and beheld only by a very few.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither can God be <hi>juſtified in the ſight of the world,</hi> by any act, Baptiſmall or other, which either is in it ſelf doubtfully and diſputably good (at the beſt) or, 2. is in itsſelf irregular or unlawfull, or 3. which is ſo apprehended by the world. Now ſuch Baptiſmall actions, as Mr. <hi>A.</hi> contends for and practiſeth, are 1. doubtfully good, at the beſt, the farre greater part of men Grave, Sober, and Judicious, judging and condemning them as unwarrantable and unlawfull.

               <p n="3">3. When wicked and unworthy perſons are baptized (a kind of traveller too often met with in Mr. <hi>A's</hi> way) God is ſo far from being <hi>juſtified</hi> hereby, that he is rather diſhonoured and reproached. <hi>But unto the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:118706:179"/> with his Baptiſm;</hi> yet 1. it doth not follow, that hereby they <hi>juſtified</hi> him, <hi>as touching the truth of his ſayings in the Goſpell.</hi> For as yet, I mean, whilſt the great recourſe of people (here implyed) unto <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptiſm, continued, the Goſpell was not known, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had been preached in the world; nor did the world underſtand what the <hi>ſayings</hi> thereof were, or rather, what they would be, or were like to be. Therefore the <hi>juſtifying of God as touhing the truth of theſe,</hi> could be no ſuch <hi>effect, or uſe, of Baptiſm,</hi> no not of the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the perſons <hi>baptized</hi> by <hi>Iohn,</hi> as Mr. <hi>A.</hi> pretendeth.

Nor doth it follow, that though they juſtified God, in theſe reſpects, by being <hi>Baptized</hi> by <hi>John,</hi> that therefore they juſtified him <hi>in the ſight of the world,</hi> there being little or (perhaps) nothing, of the world preſent, when they were baptized.

                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:118706:180"/> Yet 2. that Infant-Baptiſm <hi>contributes</hi> every whit as much (or rather more) <hi>to the juſtification of God as to the truth of his ſayings in the Goſpell, in the ſight of the world,</hi> as the baptizing of men and women, is evident from hence. The Parents, who offer their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto Baptiſm, are (for the moſt part, and ſhould be, alwaies) experienced <hi>Christians,</hi> and of long acquaintance with the Goſpell; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cannot reaſonably but be preſumed, to have better knowledge and aſſurance both of the truth, and likewiſe of the goodneſſe of <hi>the ſayings of God in the Goſpell,</hi> then men and women who are newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Goſpell; who notwithſtanding accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Goſpell rule (in caſe of a non-pre-baptiſm) yea and according to Mr. <hi>A's</hi> principles themſelves (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſuch a caſe, or otherwiſe) are the only men and women that ought to be baptized (excepting the caſe of overſight) Now 1. it cannot be thought, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, being long experienced <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> would offer their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be baptized, unleſſe themſelves were verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded both of the <hi>truth,</hi> and goodneſſe, <hi>of the ſayings of God in the Goſpell.</hi> And 2. the teſtimonie of thoſe concerning the <hi>truth</hi> and goodneſſe of things, or ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, who have beſt known, and had the moſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of them, amounts to a richer and fuller <hi>justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of them, and ſo of him who hath ſpoken them, then the teſtimonie of ſuch perſons, who are (at leaſt comparatively) ſtrangers to them.

The aſpect which the latter verſe hath upon the former, is plainly this. The Apoſtle in the former, having delivered this for truth unto them, that <hi>they were all, [viz.</hi> who truly believed] <hi>the Sons of God by Faith in Chriſt Ieſus; (viz.</hi> without any Legall obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as we formerly expounded) in the latter gives this for a reaſon, why they ſhould the rather believe it, [I mean, that they were <hi>the Sons of God by Faith in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> without the help of any legall ceremonie] becauſe many of them had ſubmitted unto Baptiſm, had been baptized into <hi>Chriſt;</hi> by which act of ſubmiſſion they <hi>put</hi> on Chriſt, i. ſolemnly profeſſed and engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves totally to conform and adhere to the Diſcipline of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Goſpell, where no Law-ceremonie hath place, or is allowed, much leſſe impoſed upon any man.

The Apoſtle here ſuppoſeth, or taketh for granted, (as well he might) that all thoſe amongſt them who had been <hi>baptized into Chriſt,</hi> had been thus <hi>baptized,</hi> by, or according to, the will of God. This interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his argument in ver. 27. to prove what he had affirmed, ver. 26. <hi>viz.</hi> that they were all the complete or adult, <hi>Sons of God, by Faith in Chriſt,</hi> without the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, makes him to ſpeak and argue

If they look on them as no <hi>Saints</hi> at all, and in this capacitie baptize them, then they bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize men, <hi>quatenus</hi> the children of the Devill, or <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus</hi> eſteemed ſuch: and if ſo, they are bound to admit none to Baptiſm, but thoſe who can give an account
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:118706:186"/> of their unbelief, and of their relation of Son-ſhip to the Divell. Or (4. and laſtly) if they look upon them, as perſons who may, or may not be ſaints, for any thing they know of them, and in this condition baptize them, then are they bound to receive none unto Baptiſm, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom they have any teſtimonie or ground to beleeve that they are the children of God; nor indeed any but only ſuch, who are mere ſtrangers unto them, and of whom they never heard either good, or evill. Therefore Mr. <hi>A's</hi> conceit about the <hi>viſibilitie</hi> of Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by means of Baptiſm, is evidently overthrown by his own Doctrine and practiſe of baptizing.</p>

Theſe are ſtrange kinds of reaſonings from the tongues and pens of ſober men. Or were there not many in the primitive times themſelves, who wore the liverie of Baptiſm, and yet were no Saints, or children of God?

                  <hi>I have inſiſted</hi> (ſaith he, p. 24.) <hi>the more largely upon this particular, to detect the repugnancie of that opinion againſt the plain current of the Scripture, which holds Baptiſm needleſſe, uſeleſſe, amongſt thoſe who have made long profeſſion of the Goſpell, though they as yet never were Baptized.</hi> How Mr. <hi>A.</hi> may otherwiſe acquit himſelf in <hi>detecting the repugnancie</hi> he ſpeaks of, I ſhall not prejudge; But if he hath no better light whereby to make the <hi>detection,</hi> then what he hath ſhined from his pen in managing his laſt particular, I am certain the <hi>opinion</hi> he ſpeaks of will never be <hi>detected</hi> of any <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancie,</hi> either <hi>againſt the plain current of the Scripture,</hi> or any more retired vein of it. For if the main and principall end of Baptiſm be to make men <hi>viſible</hi> mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they who already are, and who of a long time have been, as <hi>viſible members</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as Baptiſm can make them, yea and more <hi>viſible,</hi> have no need of being Baptized; more then he hath of a candle, who enjoyeth the brightneſſe of the Sun at noon day.</p>
               <p>Upon the ground which he hath bought with a great ſumme of diſcourſe, although his title to it be craſie (as hath been proved) yet he builds with confidence enough, p. 24. <hi>If then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that publique owning of Chriſt in Baptiſm, by which men put him on, and by, &amp; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they are incorporated into Chriſt viſibly, be another end or uſe of Baptiſm, as you ſee it is,</hi> (truly if Mr. <hi>A.</hi> ſpeaks this to me, he ſpeaks not truly) <hi>moſt clear and evident it is, that this end and uſe is not to be found in the Baptiſm of Infants.</hi> For further argument ſake, give we back again unto him his <hi>If,</hi> or antecedent in this place, which we have taken from him, and let us weigh the reaſon he gives for his drawing the conſequent here held forth unto us from it. <hi>And the reaſon</hi> (ſaith he, p. 24, 25.) <hi>hereof is, becauſe Infants neither do, nor can, put on Chriſt in their baptiſm,</hi> i. <hi>make an actuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and profeſſion unto the world, that they own and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, to be the Son of

               <p n="1">1. From what quarter of the Scriptures can Mr. <hi>A.</hi> give us any ſteady intelligence, that <hi>to put on Chriſt in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> is, or ſignifies, to <hi>make an actuall declaration and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to the world, that they own and acknowledge Chriſt Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> whether doth he think that all thoſe who were baptized by <hi>John, made</hi> ſuch <hi>a declaration and profeſſion</hi> as he ſpeaks of, <hi>viz.</hi> that they <hi>owned and acknowledged Chriſt to have been come in the fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> conſidering that the generalitie, (as it ſeems) or (however) a very great number of theſe perſons were in doubt, and <hi>muſed in their hearts of John, whether he were the Chriſt or no, Luk</hi> 3. 15? Or doth he think that the three thouſand that were Baptized in one day by <hi>Peter,</hi> or by his advice &amp; order, made every man and woman of them a part ſuch a formall <hi>actuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> and <hi>profeſſion</hi> as he ſpeaks of? If he thus think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, I muſt <hi>profeſſe</hi> that his thoughts are not mine. Or can he find that ſuch a <hi>declaration and profeſſion</hi> was ever made by any perſon, man or woman, at the time of their baptizing? yea or can he find where ever the making of ſuch a <hi>declaration</hi> or <hi>profeſſion</hi> was required at any mans hand, at the time of his baptizing? For though <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Eunuch, If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayeſt</hi> [be baptized] this doth not amount to an injunction laid upon him to profeſſe it, much leſſe <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to declare and profeſſe it unto the world.</hi> Nor did the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, actually declare</hi> this his <hi>belief unto the world,</hi> unleſſe Mr. <hi>A.</hi> thinks that <hi>Philip</hi> here ſignifies <hi>the world.</hi>

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:118706:191"/> this <hi>Declaration</hi> was not made by them before their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing: 2. whether this <hi>Declaration</hi> did not make them every which as much (if not more) <hi>viſible Saints</hi> or members of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as their Baptiſm did. If ſo, how can Mr. <hi>A's</hi> Doctrine (lately taught by him as we have heard) ſtand, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>no perſon is to be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as having a viſible being in Chriſt, by any Act, Endowment, or Qualification preceding Baptiſm?</hi> But</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4. (And laſtly, for this) Be we yet more open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed to Mr. <hi>A.</hi> and beſtow upon him the grant, that the <hi>end and uſe of Baptiſm</hi> of which he ſpeaks, <hi>is not found in the Baptiſm of Infants,</hi> yet neither would this forbid water that Infants ſhould not be Baptized, becauſe there being (according to Mr. <hi>A's</hi> own principls) ſeverall ends of Baptiſm, in caſe any one of theſe be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by the baptizing of Infants, Infants lawfully may, yea and of duty ought to be baptized.

               <p>Whereas he ſaith (p. 25.) <hi>that infants cannot with any proprietie of truth of ſpeaking, be ſaid to put on Chriſt in Baptiſm;</hi> 1. I ſuppoſe that neither can men or women, with <hi>proprietie of ſpeaking,</hi> be ſaid to <hi>put on Chriſt</hi> in Baptiſm. To <hi>put on Chriſt,</hi> whether in Baptiſm, or
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:118706:192"/> otherwiſe, is a Metaphoricall or borrowed expreſſion, not a proper. 2. Why may not Infants with as much <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie,</hi> yea and <hi>truth</hi> of ſpeaking, be ſaid to <hi>put on Chriſt</hi> in Baptiſm, as Infants under the Law may be ſaid to have put on <hi>Moſes</hi> in circumciſion? Or did not infants in their circumciſion, as <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>truly</hi> put on <hi>Moſes,</hi> as men themſelves did in theirs? 3. Neither doth the Apoſtle ſay, that they who have been baptized, <hi>have put on Chriſt, in,</hi> or by Baptiſm: this is Mr. <hi>A's</hi> gloſſe, not the Apoſtles Text. His words are only theſe, <hi>Gal. 3. 27. For as many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt.</hi> It is not denied but that perſons bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized may with good congruitie of ſence, be ſaid <hi>to put on Chriſt in Baptiſm;</hi> only this is denied, that Mr. <hi>A.</hi> can evince or juſtifie ſuch an expreſſion, or ſence from the ſaid paſſage of the Apoſtle. For they who have been <hi>baptized into Chriſt,</hi> may very poſſibly have other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe put on Chriſt, and not by this their <hi>baptizing into him.</hi> This propoſition, <hi>They that have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt,</hi> may be (as Logicians ſpeak) <hi>propoſitio conſecutiva,</hi> and not, <hi>formalis;</hi> a propoſition, wherein the conſequent is predicated of the antecedent, not the thing ſignified, or typified, of the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, nor yet the effect of the cauſe. As when the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the ſons of God, (Rom.</hi> 8. 14.) he doth not ſuppoſe, that men are conſtituted or made <hi>the ſons of God</hi> by being <hi>led by the Spirit of God,</hi> but only decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be ſo: their conſtitution in this kind is by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe, or means. In like manner a baptizing into <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be an argument, or ſign, that men have put on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and yet not be that act, by which, or in which, they <hi>formally</hi> put him on. Nay the truth is, that, to <hi>put on Chriſt,</hi> being, or importing, an act, it cannot be tranſacted, or performed, in, or by, a mans being baptized, becauſe this importeth a paſſion. If it be ſaid; yea but a ſubmiſſion, or voluntarie offering of a mans ſelf, unto baptiſm, imports an action, and by
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:118706:192"/> this, or in this, he may be ſaid to <hi>put on Christ,</hi> I anſwer, If <hi>Chriſt</hi> be <hi>put on</hi> by a mans offering himſelf unto Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm (which for ought I ſee at preſent, may be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) then is he not <hi>put on</hi> by Baptiſm, but before it; yea and they may as properly be ſaid to put on <hi>Christ,</hi> who never are actually baptized, as they who are. For evident it is, that in the baptizing of men and women, the offering of themſelves unto Baptiſm alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes their Baptiſm it-ſelf: and as evident again it is, that men and women may offer themſelves unto Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and yet (poſſibly) never be baptized: as <hi>viz.</hi> when there is no perſon preſent that is willing to accept of their offer in this kind, or to adminiſter baptiſm unto them.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>A.</hi> having riſen up early, and gon to bed late, and eaten the bread of much carefulneſſe, to give the beſt complexion and colour to his ſecond Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the lawfulneſſe of Infant-baptiſm, which he was capable of giving, and that of receiving, and being loth that what he had ſo carefully planted, ſhould be preſently pluck'd up by the hand of an objection, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares and arms himſelf to diſcomfit (if it may be) that objection, which (in his apprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) threatned him with this damage.

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:118706:193"/> reaſon to ſuppoſe, that circumciſion ſhould have leſſe anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ends thereof when applied to Infants; as there is to conceive, that Baptiſm ſhould leſſe anſwer its ends, when it is applied to Infants; and yet we well know that this was no barre to Infant-circumciſion then, and therefore why ſhould it be any againſt their Baptiſm now?</hi> This argument, or Objection, is the great dread and abhorring of Mr. <hi>A's</hi> ſoul, fearing (it ſeems) leaſt his ſecond argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t againſt Infant-Baptiſm ſhould die by the hand of it. And the truth is that were it yet alive, he had reaſon enough for ſuch his fear: but we have ſeen it a dead corps already, a body of words without any ſoul of ſound reaſon, or truth in it. And how vain a thing is it to be ſolicitous about the reſcue of a dead mans life from the hand of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie?

               <p>His objection (as ye have heard) pleads, <hi>that there is the ſame reaſon to ſuppoſe, that circumciſion ſhould have leſſe anſwered the ends thereof when applied to Infants, as there is to conceive, that Baptiſm ſhould leſſe anſwer its ends, when applied unto Infants, &amp;c.</hi> This Mr. <hi>A's</hi> anſwer denieth: and no marvell: for what ſhould it elſe do, unleſſe it meant to be an anſwer by conceſſion only?

               <p>Firſt be ſaith (p. 26.) that <hi>Circumciſion, and the Covenant to which it related, remained in the fleſh of him, who was circumciſed, all the dayes of his life, as viſible to him, and as capable of improvement to ſpirituall ends many years after it was made, as if it had been but newly acted and done before his eyes.—Whereas Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is a tranſient act, and leaves no ſuch viſible impreſſion in the Infant, as matter of memoriall, ſignification, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction unto him when he comes to be a man, as that of Circumciſion did.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an externall <hi>viſibilitie</hi> is no Scripture-difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Circumciſion and Baptiſm; nor (indeed) is it in it ſelf any ſuch difference, which ſhould make the former any whit more <hi>ſpiritually</hi> advantagious unto the ſubject thereof, then the latter (Baptiſm) unto its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.

The reaſon or ground which children of any growth, or years have to believe, that ſuch perſons, eſpecially one of them, who are commonly called and reputed their Parents, are ſo indeed, is nothing ſo authentique or full of proof, as the foreſaid teſtimonies and grounds of their baptizing. Jealouſies and ſuſpicions about the legitimacie of many Children, are (we know) rife in the mouths of men: but (I believe) never did Mr. <hi>A.</hi> hear the Baptiſm of any perſon queſtioned, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was atteſted by the Parents, or by any Pariſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter, or Record. And yet perſons ſtand bound by the Law of God, to honour thoſe, as their Parents, and to perform all other duties and reſpects unto them, which are due from children unto Parents, who are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called and reputed their Parents, although they have no demonſtrative proof of ſuch a relation to them. Therefore much more, if perſons be reported, both by their Parents, and others, to have been baptized, and are generally reputed ſo to have been, they ſtand as well, and as much bound to look upon themſelves, as baptized, and to act and walk accordingly, as if they knew with the greateſt certaintie that they had been baptized.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

The reaſon (it ſeems) why <hi>Peter</hi> mentioneth Water-Baptiſm as typically <hi>ſaving</hi> us, as the <hi>demand</hi> he ſpeaks of ſaves us (in part, and to a degree) really, is, becauſe having had occaſion to ſpeak of the preſervation of <hi>Noah</hi> and his familie from periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the generall deluge, wherein all the world beſides periſhed, by means of the ark, he conceived there was a kind of typical reſemblance thereof in Baptiſm, or rather a typicall overture made herein by God of ſuch a like preſervation unto Godly perſons, when the whole world of unrighteous ones round about ſhould be deſtroyed, and periſh in their ſins. So that <hi>Peter</hi> in this place, aſcribes no other ſalvation, or ſalvation in no other ſence, unto <hi>Baptiſm it ſelf</hi> (I mean, unto Water-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm) then wherein it was altogether as aſcribable unto the carnall Obſervations, as <hi>viz.</hi> to the offering of <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Goats, &amp;c.</hi> under the Law. For as theſe did overture, and (after a ſort) promiſe ſalvation, by the true ſacrifice of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> yet to be obtained and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by thoſe only, who believe; (we alwaies in this caſe ſpeak only of perſons capable by years, and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of believing) ſo doth Water-Baptiſm hold forth pardon and forgiveneſſe of ſins, and conſequently ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as attainable by all thoſe, and thoſe only, who repent, and conſequently beleeve. And as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm edifieth, profiteth, bleſſeth no man, but only thoſe, who repent and believe; ſo neither did Circumciſion (as we formerly heard) nor other externall Obſervations under the Law. Therefore Mr. <hi>A.</hi> hath caught no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:118706:201"/> at all by fiſhing in theſe waters, for the relief of his cauſe. Nor needed he at all have troubled either himſelf, or his reader, with quotations from the Scriptures, to prove, that a baptizing with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without a baptizing with the Spirit alſo, makes more againſt, then for, him, that ſhall be baptized: nor hath he miniſtred any thing to the neceſſitie of his cauſe hereby. This required at his hand, that which he had not to give unto it, I mean, a ſubſtantiall proof, that the nature of the <hi>miniſtration of the Law</hi> was ſuch, that the literall and externall performance of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and carnall Ordinances thereof, were, without repentance or faith, of better acceptance with God, and more available to the ſalvation of the Performers, then Goſpell Ordinances are without the like qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>

Whereas he ſaith (p. 28.) that <hi>Infants, as they are not capable of acting this faith, or making this anſwer of a good Conſcience, ſo they are not capable of thoſe bleſſings and benefits intended by God in Baptiſm, in as much as he hath ſuſpended the donation thereof upon theſe, in conjunction with Baptiſm;</hi> I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It hath been ſufficiently proved, that Infants are capable (though with a mediate, or remote capacitie) of <hi>acting Faith,</hi> as well as men. See Sect. 64, 65, 68, 69.

               <p>1. The groundwork and foundation of his building here is ſandie and looſe. For he ſuppoſeth that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:118706:202"/> was therefore, in that conſideration, a weak, or leſſe Spirituall Ordinance, becauſe the adminiſtration of it was made unto children; and ſemblably, that Baptiſm would be, or muſt appear to be, a weaker and leſſe ſpirituall Ordinance then it is, in caſe it were to be adminiſtred unto children. Whereas the evident truth is, that the ſtrength, richneſſe, or ſpiritualneſſe of an Ordinance, doth not ſo much (if at all) conſiſt in the ſtrength or ſpiritualneſſe of the ſubject, to which it is adminiſtred, or is adminiſtrable, as in the intrinſecall nature of it, richneſſe of ſignification, or promiſed preſence of God with it. Circumciſion was the ſame Ordinance, equally ſpirituall, and no whit more weak, when it was adminiſtred unto <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and afterwards unto <hi>Paul,</hi> on the eight day, then it was when adminiſtred unto <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, and afterwards unto thoſe who were circumciſed men, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.

               <p>The Premiſes conſidered, I ſuppoſe the Reader can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lightly but think, that Mr. <hi>A.</hi> was farre better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, then he, of his late diſcourſe touching the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between circumciſion, and Baptiſm, inaſmuch as he concludeth it thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By this time I hope it appears, that there is not the ſame reaſon why Baptiſm adminiſtred unto Infants ſhould reach</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>A.</hi> p. 29</note> 
                  <hi>the ends thereof, as there was why Circumciſion, though applyed to Infants formerly, ſhould attain its end. For the nature of the two Ordinances differ, the terms of their admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration differ, and the reſpective capacities of the Church then, and the Church now, differ: and according to that rule in Logick, where the things them ſelves differ, there the reaſon of thoſe things differ alſo.</hi> I anſwer briefly;</p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:118706:204"/>
               <p>It hath been ſufficiently proved, and this lately enough, that there is the ſame reaſon altogether why Baptiſm adminiſtred unto Infants ſhould reach the ends thereof, which there is or was, why circumciſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adminiſtred unto Infants alſo, ſhould attain the ends of it. Neither doth any difference found, either in the nature of the two Ordinances, or in the terms of their Adminiſtration, or in the capacities of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, then and now, diverſifie the ſaid reaſon, or prove in the leaſt, that Infant-Baptiſm ſhould be leſſe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to atchieve and compaſſe all Baptiſmall ends, then Infant-circumciſion was to attain the ends of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Old reliques, and new-made Idols, differ in their natures: they differ, or may differ, in their adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or communications, unto the people: Papiſts and Proteſtants may be in a different capacitie to underſtand the evill of them: and yet all theſe, and ten times more, differences like unto theſe, notwithſtanding, there may be the ſame reaſon why the one ſhould occaſion, or produce the evill which is proper for it to produce, which there is for the other to do likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Nor is it true that the Church, during Circumciſion, was, in that part (at leaſt) or in thoſe members<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of it, who by the ſtanding law were to be circumciſed, (I mean, in the children or Infants belonging to it) in a different capacitie from the church now (under Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm) in the Infants hereof. The Infants of the church, or of Believers, now are as capable of the ends of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as the Infants of the Jewiſh church were of the ends of circumciſion. Therefore Mr. <hi>A.</hi> all the while he hath been labouring to overthrow the parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Infant-Baptiſm, and Infant-circumciſion, hath dwelt at the ſign of the Labour-in vain.

               <p>1.

               <p n="1">1. If Mr. <hi>A.</hi> hath nothing elſe to make good his minor Propoſition in this argument, then <hi>what he made good in his former,</hi> the Propoſition muſt ſtand upon its own bottom, and ſhift for it ſelf. For it hath been <hi>made good,</hi> that in that argument he <hi>made</hi> nothing <hi>good</hi> at all, at leaſt nothing relating to his Propoſition here.</p>

                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:118706:205"/>2. Whereas he bears upon this Principle, that <hi>what is leſſe edifying is more ſutable and conformable to the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law, becauſe this was a miniſtration of leſſe light and edification,</hi> doth he not leane upon a broken reed, that will pierce his hand? For ſuppoſe we (that which is little queſtionable, or however, poſſible) that the miniſtery, or preaching of <hi>Andrew, Bartholomew,</hi> or or any other of the Apoſtles, was <hi>leſſe edifying,</hi> then the Miniſterie or preaching of <hi>Paul,</hi> doth this prove that their Miniſterie was in any degree <hi>ſutable, or conformable to the miniſtration of the Law;</hi> or however, unſuitable unto, or unlawfull under, the Goſpell?

               <p>3. Suppoſe there had been no ſuch Ordinance as Circumciſion under the Law, no precept that Infants ſhould have been circumciſed; yet upon a ſuppoſall of this Ordinance given, or to be given, there would have been the ſame reaſon, one or more, which now there was, why it ſhould be adminiſtred, &amp; conſequently, why God ſhould injoyn it to be adminiſtred to Infants. Now that we intereſſe the mention, either of the example, or of the precept, of Infant Circumciſion, in our diſputes about Baptiſm, we do it not ſo much, if at all, for the letter of either, as for the ſpirit of them; i. for thoſe reaſons ſake, upon which we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>udge them to have been founded by God. For though the letter of the Precept enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Circumciſion, and ſo the practiſe of Circumciſion conformable hereunto, be purely Legall; yet the reaſons upon which the precept was given, and the practiſe ſtood, or ought to have ſtood, were Evangelicall; my meaning is, that the Precept of Infant-circumciſion was calculated by God for this end, and with this intention given by him, that by ſuch an Adminiſtration, as the precept directeth unto, and injoyneth, the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance might be the more richly edifying to the Church now in being. There is the ſame conſideration of all other ceremoniall precepts and injunctions under the Law. Though the matter of every of theſe precepts (reſpectively) or the externall ceremonie it ſelf enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was ſuch, that by no form whatſoever put upon it, or by no ordering or diſpoſing it, it could be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to an equall ſerviceableneſſe in matters of edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with the rich and high diſcoveries of the Goſpell; yet was it ſo ordered and diſpoſed by God in the uſe and practique of it, that it might yield to the Church the moſt ſpirituall benefit, and beſt degree of edification, which it was regularly capable to doe. And if any thing appertaining to the manner of any legall ſervice or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:118706:207"/> enjoyned, had been altered or changed in the command, and ſo in the practiſe, from what was now directed and preſcribed, it would have been prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to the benefit and edification, which the Church now received, or might have received, by thoſe ceremoniall ſervices. Otherwiſe we muſt ſay, that men themſelves (the <hi>Jews</hi>) might poſſibly have bettered their ſpirituall condition, by altering and changing, at leaſt in ſome particulars, the Law given by God himſelf unto them, and this for the advancement of ſuch their condition. The clear amount or conſequent of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is, that in caſe there be any ceremonie, or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall ſervice, enjoyned by God under the Goſpell, of like nature and conſideration with any of thoſe, which were preſcribed in the Law; unleſſe the manner and terms for the uſe, practiſe, or adminiſtration of it, ſhall be the ſame (at leaſt in the main) with thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for the practiſe of the correſponding ceremonie under the Law, this Goſpell ceremonie muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be the leſſe edifying by means of a variation in this kind. Now that Baptiſm is a ceremonie, or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall ſervice under the Goſpell, correſponding with Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion under the Law, is in it ſelf ſo manifeſt, and ſo generally by ſober and conſidering men acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>A.</hi> is too tender of forehead to deny it. If ſo, then it roundly followeth, that, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Law preſcribed the ordinarie adminiſtration of Circumciſion unto children, the Goſpell muſt allow, or intend, the like adminiſtration of Baptiſm unto chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren likewiſe; otherwiſe the adminiſtration of it muſt be leſſe beneficiall and edifying to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church. Therefore</p>

               <p>4. Whereas Mr. <hi>A.</hi> ſaith, that <hi>ſuch Arguments and Pleas</hi> [he means, which are <hi>deduced from the example of Infant-Circumciſion] tend to draw down this part of the Goſpell miniſtration</hi> [he means, the adminiſtration of Baptiſm] <hi>as applicable unto Infants, unto the line and levell
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:118706:207"/> of the legall,</hi> doubtleſſe he underſtandeth not what he ſaith. For 1. if Baptiſm be no part of the Goſpell, but an appendix only, (which I ſuppoſe was ſufficiently proved, Sect. 102.) then is not the adminiſtration of Baptiſm properly any part of the Goſpell miniſtration, but only an adminiſtration collaterall hereunto. But 2. grant we the adminiſtration of Baptiſm to be a part of the Goſpell miniſtration, Mr. <hi>A.</hi> had ſmall reaſon to complain, that we by applying it unto Infants, <hi>draw it down TO the line and levell of the Legall,</hi> when as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his, by denying it unto Infants, draw it down many degrees beneath the <hi>Legall miniſtration</hi> he ſpeaks of. For this (as we lately ſhewed) made the beſt improvement of the Ordinances and ceremonies then on foot, for the ſpirituall benefit and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Church in edification and comfort, that well might be; and upon this account ordered the ſtanding adminiſtration of Circumciſion unto Infants. Nor is the Goſpel miniſtration it ſelf, in any ſuch reſpect preferr'd before the Legal, either by <hi>Chriſt, Paul,</hi> or any other Apoſtle, <hi>viz.</hi> that the adminiſtration of the Goſpel ceremonies is contrived either with more wiſdom, or more goodneſſe by God, for the accompliſhing of the gracious ends intended (reſpectively) in them, then the Law-ceremonies and ſervices were in reference to their reſpective ends: but, partly becauſe the ceremonies of the Goſpell, are more rich in ſignification, then thoſe of the Law were, and conſequently their reſpective ends are more rich and gracious; partly becauſe Goſpell diſcoveries of God, and of the myſterie of his will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſalvation of men, are much more full and glorious, then the Legal were; partly alſo becauſe there is a larger donation, or effuſion of the Spirit, and ſo the hearts and conſciences of men more effectually dealt with, under the Goſpell, then under the Law. So that that adminiſtration of Baptiſm, which Mr. <hi>A.</hi> cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureth, compared with that which he approveth, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a drawing up, then <hi>a drawing down,</hi> of the Goſpell

The like counſell of God is obſervable, in his enditing of that Ordinance, which he intended ſhould be initiatorie, and primarily and miniſtrable unto
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:118706:219"/> Infants under the Law. Circumciſion was an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ſuch a nature, ſo conditioned, that it required nothing but a regular paſſiveneſs in its ſubject (I mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, its ordinarie and moſt appropriate ſubject) to the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.

               <p>2.

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:118706:221"/> becauſe many of thoſe with whom we have chiefly to do in this writing, are not ſo well able to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween words, and ſubſtance of matter, let us examine the argument in the former words, wherein it ſtands now laſt recommended to us.</p>
               <p>The whole weight and ſtrength of the Argument, depends upon the ſence, and truth of this Poſition, <hi>That none ought to be Baptized but ſuch who appear voluntarily willing to be baptized in obedience to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, for the ſence of this Poſition; 1. it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, whether by, <hi>voluntarily willing,</hi> he means that which the terms preciſely import, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch, who are freely of their own accord, and without much conteſting by others, as by arguments, perſwaſions, and the like, <hi>willing;</hi> or whether ſuch, who are very intenſly, or more then ordinarily willing, whether this intenſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>willingneſſe</hi> in them be from themſelves, or from others. For that by <hi>voluntarily willing,</hi> he ſhould mean nothing but ſimply and meerly <hi>willing,</hi> eſpecially in a preſſe and cloſe Syllogiſm, or Argument, is not eaſie to be believed. Now taking the Phraſe, <hi>voluntarily wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> in either of the two former ſignifications, the ſaid Propoſition is apparantly untrue. For not only they, who <hi>appear willing</hi> of themſelves, and of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, or who <hi>appear</hi> extraordinarily, and without any the leaſt regret, or degree of unwillingneſſe, <hi>willing,</hi> but even they who appear <hi>willing</hi> in any ſuch degree, as to require Baptiſm, may be Baptized, at leaſt, if other things required in thoſe who are, or deſire to be baptized, be not wanting. This (I ſuppoſe) will not be gainſaid by Mr. <hi>A.</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>2. When the ſaid Propoſition ſaith, <hi>That none ought to be baptized, but ſuch who appear voluntarily willing, &amp;c.</hi> If it deſires to be underſtood of perſons capable of the appearance it ſpeaks of, it may paſſe. But thus underſtood, it prevaricates with the Concluſion, which it undertakes, to protect and prove, and doth it no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:118706:221"/> Therefore I make no queſtion but the Authors meaning in it is rightout this: <hi>That none,</hi> i. no perſon whatſoever, of what capacitie, or incapacitie ſoever, <hi>ought to be baptized, but ſuch</hi> [only] <hi>who appear willing to be baptized.</hi> The Propoſition then in this ſence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, we abſolutely deny.</p>

               <p>5. The Apoſtles Order is, that <hi>all things</hi> in the Church ſhould <hi>be done to edification;</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 26.</note> Doubtleſſe his meaning is, that all things ought to be done to the beſt advantage, for the beſt and higheſt promoting of this end. Now that the conſtant adminiſtration of Baptiſm unto children, makes much more for the <hi>edification</hi> of the Church, then the adminiſtration of it unto perſons of years only, hath been demonſtratively aſſerted former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Sect. 56. 73. Yet for the further confirmation and clearing of the buſineſſe, other conſiderations may be added to what is delivered in thoſe Sections.</p>
               <p>.1 There is little queſtion to be made but that God intended the edification of his Church under the Law, and this upon the beſt terms, not only, or ſimply, or by Circumciſion, or by the adminiſtration thereof, but in, and by, his Election of, and preciſe order about, the more appropriate and ſtanding ſubject hereof. This, for for the matter and ſubſtance of it, hath likewiſe been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved, Sect. 138. If the truth of it yet ſtick in the throat of any mans judgment, and will not down pleaſantly, he may be relieved by this conſideration. If God did intend the edification of the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> by Circumciſion, and the adminiſtration thereof, and did not likewiſe intend the edification of this Church in his choice and appointment of the ordinarie &amp; ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject of this adminiſtration, then was he divided in, and againſt, himſelf; yea and gave ſuch a Law unto his people, one clauſe whereof obſerved ſhould tend to bleſſe them, another, prejudice them, or at beſt do them no ſervice at all. Now if the adminiſtration of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion unto children was judged by God himſelf the

The differences pretended by Mr. <hi>A.</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cloſe of his ſecond argument, between the one adminiſtration and the other, upon examination of them, we found to be meer impertinences and ſhifts, from Sect. 120. to the end of Sect. 134. where the Reader may pleaſe to peruſe their reſpective examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

Whereas the Baptizing of men and women (at leaſt if they were baptized, as Mr. <hi>A.</hi> himſelf acknowledgeth they ought to be, I mean, upon their firſt believing) accommodateth the Church with the teſtimonie and profeſſion of young converts only, and ſuch who are as yet unexperienced in the word of righteouſneſſe, and little other then ſtrangers unto the Goſpell. In which reſpect their teſtimonie and profeſſion cannot be of like authoritie, weight, or edification to the Church, with theirs, who have been in <hi>Chriſt</hi> many years before them, and ſtill continue ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Infant-Baptiſm maketh more for the edification of the Church, then after-Baptiſm, upon this account alſo. When Infants are baptized, the whole Church may, and this with conuenience, and without breach
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:118706:223"/> upon their other occaſions, be preſent, and ſo partake of all the fruits, benefits, and accommodations of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. Whereas when men and women are baptized, very few of the Church, eſpecially in many places, can have the opportunitie of being preſent, the place of the adminiſtration in this caſe being remote, (at leaſt where Rivers or Pools of water, convenient for the ſervice, are not neer at hand) and the time like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the ſaid adminiſtration, can hardly be notified unto the generalitie of the Church. In which reſpect this Baptiſmall adminiſtration cannot be much edifying to the Church, nor comparable with that, which may be, and ought to be, (and in part) is, (ofttimes) made unto children.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Infant-Baptiſm affords many more occaſions and opportunities for the adminiſtration of the Ordinance, and conſequently, for the edification of the Church, then Beleever baptiſm doth. For the children of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are many more in number, then Beleevers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: and many thouſands live to a week, or moneth, who are prevented by death before they come to years of diſcretion, and ſo much as to a capacitie of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.

And they on the contrary wiſely and graciouſly conſult the obedience of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to that heavenly exhortation, who prevent them with, and lay upon them, a baptiſmal engagement here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, in their Infancy. 1. It cannot be denied but that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:118706:224"/> is an ingagement to that <hi>duty,</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth by a mans <hi>remembring</hi> his <hi>Creatour.</hi> 2. Neither can it be denied, but that men and women in their <hi>youth,</hi> and as ſoon as they are capable of the duty it ſelf of <hi>remembring</hi> their <hi>Creatour,</hi> are capable of the ſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement alſo; I mean, of underſtanding and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that their being baptized, is, and ought to be unto them a motive unto this dutie. 3. Neither can it reaſonably be denyed, but that they who are actually capable of a motive or ingagement unto a duty, or work, may, thorow want of this motive or ingagement lying on them, neglect the performance of the duty, which under an ingagement, they would perform, and not neglect. 4. Every mans ſence may teach him, that when the two ſcales of a ballance are equally poiſed, a very ſmall weight caſt into either, will caſt it. 5. (And laſtly) from theſe premiſes it roundly followeth, that any mans children, who know themſelves unbaptized, and ſo free from the ingagement of Baptiſm, may from hence take occaſion to neglect the dutie of <hi>remembring their Creatour in the dayes of their youth,</hi> a duty which would lye with more weight and authoritie upon their conſciences (and ſo weas more likely to be performed) did they look upon themſelves as by Baptiſm ingaged unto it. I am not poſitive in affirming, that ever the Son or Daughter of any Parent did actually miſcarrie upon the account we ſpeak of: but this I ſay, with ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of conviction in my judgment and conſcience, 1. that it may very poſſibly come to paſſe, that a Child, Son, or Daughter, unbaptized, may be leſſe thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and carefull, <hi>to remember their Creatour in the dayes of their youth,</hi> by underſtanding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves free &amp; looſe from a baptiſmall tie and engagement thereunto. 2. That in caſe the child of any Parent ſhall ſtumble at that ſtone we now ſpeak of, and fall, and be broken to pieces by it, the parents of this child, being acceſſary hereunto, will be able to give but a ſad account of the loſſe of their child unto God. 3. (And laſtly) that whatſoever
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:118706:224"/> the conſequent or event of a non-baptizing a child in his infancie, ſhall, or may be, evident it is, that in this caſe, the Parents, or Vice-parents, upon whoſe hand the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> nurture of this child ſhall lie, will want a very materiall and weighty argument, whereby to work his judgment and conſcience to the remembrance of his Creatour. And (doubtleſſe) the reaſon why God threatned the uncircumciſed manchild amongſt <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> poſteritie, with a <hi>cutting off from his people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 17. 14</note> was not to ſignifie, that this judgement ſhould univerſally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall every man-child amongſt them, which poſſibly tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the neglect of his Parents ſhould be uncircumciſed, but to awaken the care and conſcience of every Parent of ſuch children amongſt them, to circumciſe them, leſt the want of this Ordinance ſhould occaſion them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate ſuch things, which ſhould and ought to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſuch a judgment.

But Baptiſm, in reſpect of the baptized, is no action, or ſervice per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: nor doth the reception of it as ſuch, require any principle of action in the receiver. See this ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved, Sect. 76. and again, Sect. 153.

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:118706:226"/> in full meaſure accrue unto them. Yea I am of Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> judgment in this; that Baptiſm received in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie, and ſo before a man hath done any good, or performed any ſervice at all unto God, is, in a way of reaſon, more highly improveable to ſpirituall ends and purpoſes, then when received after beleeving.</p>

               <p>But before we are admitted to hear this, we are <hi>deſired</hi> to <hi>obſerve two things by the way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That this Argument contradicts another that is wont
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:118706:229"/> to be employed in this ſervice, to wit, that the promiſe of God belongs to children of beleeving Parents, and therefore</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>A.</hi> p. 41, 42.</note> 
                  <hi>Baptiſm: by which Baptiſm is reſtrained to ſuch Infants only, as are the children of believing Parents. But by this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Baptiſm is made to appertain to all Infants whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, whether they be children of believing, or unbelieving Parents: becauſe it ſuppoſeth all Infants to be in the love of God in the forementioned reſpect. And therefore if this be true, the other muſt be falſe in its reſtrained ſence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, if the other true, this falſe. So that you ſee the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes do no better agree in their evidence in this behalf, then the falſe witneſſes did, that came againſt Chriſt in their teſtimonie.</hi>

               <p>Before I come to ſpeak to theſe two, <hi>by the ways,</hi> I muſt deſire alſo that one thing be obſerved <hi>by the way</hi> (on the other ſide.) This is, that I have ground in abundance to believe, that he never heard any Paedo-baptiſt plead the cauſe of Infant-baptiſm by that Argument, which here he undertakes to anſwer, in thoſe terms, or tenour of words, wherein he exhibiteth it, and that he cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly changed their terms, that he might gain an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for his two <hi>by the waies,</hi> eſpecially the latter, and withall be ſuppoſed to anſwer their Argument, whilſt (indeed) he only anſwers a mock argument of his own. The Argument, which I ſuppoſe he pretends to anſwer, or would be thought to anſwer, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to have been ſometimes urged by my ſelf; nor do I remember that I have met with it from either the pen, or lips, of any other. In which reſpect I am able to ſpeak with the more confidence what I have ſaid. The true tenour then of the Argument which Mr. <hi>A.</hi>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:118706:230"/> ſhould have anſwered, had he quitted himſelf ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, is this:</p>
               <p>If the relation of Son-ſhip unto God, and not Faith, or repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be the originall or firſt ground, or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification in perſons, which render them capable of Baptiſm, then may Infants lawfully be Baptized.</p>
               <p>But this relation, and not Faith or Repentance, is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall or firſt ground in perſons, qualifying them for Baptiſm. Ergo.</p>
               <p>Had M. <hi>A.</hi> propounded the Argument in theſe terms, he had had no colour at all (or a very faint colour only) for his latter <hi>by the way.</hi> For though it be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that all men, whether <hi>Christian</hi> or <hi>Pagan, have,</hi> or rather have had, <hi>that ſin, of which they were guilty in Adam, remitted unto them</hi> (for it may be ſome doubt, whether this guilt, after remiſſion, returneth not again with the guilt of actuall ſinning, though this be a point that I ſhall never much controvert) and in that reſpect ſometimes were, or let it be, at preſent are, alike parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in the love of God, with Infants; yet doth it not follow from hence that therefore they are equall with them in the relation or priviledge of Son-ſhip, or in that love of God which accompanieth this relation. <hi>He that committeth ſin</hi> (ſaith <hi>John) is of the Divell.</hi>

If his meaning be, that the one Argument of his Adverſaries (that againſt which he is now buckling on his armour) <hi>contradicts</hi> that other argument of theirs, which he mentioneth, as one part of a contradiction contradicteth the other, he hath made a very bad bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for his cauſe <hi>by the way.</hi> For it is a generall rule without any exception, that <hi>altera pars contradictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis ſemper eſt vera;</hi> one part of every contradiction is alwayes true. Now if either of thoſe Arguments, which he ſaith <hi>contradict</hi> the one the other, be true, his Doctrine of Anti-paedobaptiſm muſt needs be falſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are both contradictions to it. For 1. if it be true, that the children of Beleevers, and theſe only, ought to be baptized, then muſt it needs be falſe, that no children at all ought to be baptized. Or 2. if it be true, that all children are capable of Baptiſm, or ought to be baptized, then it is much more apparantly falſe, that no children ought to be baptized. Therefore I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that when Mr. <hi>A.</hi> challengeth the one Argument of his Adverſaries to <hi>contradict</hi> the other, he would be underſtood to ſpeak of a <hi>contradiction</hi> ſtrictly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, but only of a <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p n="2">2. I anſwer further, that if he judgeth it any matter of prejudice to the cauſe of Infant-baptiſm, that ſome of thoſe, who maintain it, are in ſome things relating to it, differently-minded amongſt themſelves, herein alſo he conſulteth diſrepute to his own cauſe. For it is well known, that the <hi>Peter</hi> and the <hi>Paul,</hi> the two great Apoſtles of Mr. <hi>A's</hi> Re-baptiſmall Faith (I mean, Mr. <hi>J. Tombs,</hi> and Mr. <hi>S.

And laſtly) what if Mr. <hi>A.</hi> be quite miſtaken, in his ſuppoſall, that the one <hi>Argument</hi> he ſpeaks of, <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts</hi> the other? then (ſure) this <hi>by-the-way</hi> will be found out of the way, aſwell as the other. He that affirms on the one hand, that all children are capable of Baptiſm, and he who on the other hand affirms, that the children only of believers are capable hereof, do not neceſſarily contradict the one the other in theſe ſayings, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſence wherein they may be, yea, and are, both true. For all children, as ſuch, may be capable of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: and yet many of them, yea all, the children of believers only excepted, in other reſpects, uncapable. There is a double capacitie of Baptiſm (at leaſt, as the word, <hi>capacitie,</hi> may ſignifie) the one, in reſpect of the ſubject, (ſimply conſidered) the other in reſpect of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance. All children, in caſe they ſhould be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly offered unto Baptiſm, that is, 1. freely, and by thoſe that have the right of their education, as Parents, if living, or Guardians, or Foſter-parents, in caſe the naturall be dead, and 2. unto perſons, or baptiſts regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly authorized to Baptize them, they might all be baptized. But becauſe Infidell Parents cannot be free in offering their children unto Baptiſm, nor can they, being under no Paſtour, or chriſtian Church-officer, offer, or bring them to a perſon regularly authorized to baptize them (it being irregular for any Churh to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe their Paſtor, or other Officer, to baptize the children
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:118706:232"/> of unbelievers) in this repect theſe children of theirs are not capable of being baptized. That poor Cripple, who waited 38 years together for healing at the pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> was all this while, in reſpect of his perſon, or, as he was an impotent man, as capable of healing, as any of thoſe, who were healed; yea had he at any time found ſuch a friend, as would, upon the Angels ſtirring of the water, have caſt him in, before ſome other had prevented him, he had been actually healed. But being helpleſſe in himſelf, and friendleſſe, he was under theſe circumſtances, in no capacitie of being healed by thoſe waters. A Virgin in reſpect of her years and perſon every wayes, may be capable of marying ſuch or ſuch a man; yet in reſpect of the charge and command of her Parents, under whoſe power ſhe yet remains, to the contrary, ſhe may be uncapable of ſo marrying. Yea the man himſelf, with whom, in the reſpect mentioned, and in many others, ſhe is capable of marrying, may notwithſtanding be a perſon ſo, or ſo, conditioned, as (for example) may be an Idolater, or ſon of a ſtrange God, or the like, that ſhe is not in a regular actuall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie of marrying with him. Many caſes of a like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplification might be propoſed. It were eaſy to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce many ſayings out of the Scriptures themſelves, which do every whit as much <hi>contradict</hi> the one the other, as thoſe catched at, and compared, by Mr. <hi>A.</hi> whoſe conſiſtencie notwithſtanding is readily enough ſalveable by diſtinguiſhing, partly between poſitives, and reſpectives, partly, between reſpectives, and reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives.</p>
               <p>The three particulars now propounded, duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it appears that Mr. <hi>A.</hi> hath made no bargain at all, either for his credit, or for his cauſe, <hi>by the way:</hi> but it may be matters will ſucceed better with him at his journeys end. And I confeſſe that if he can come off with credit from his incounter with the argument now before him, he will do more for the cauſe of Ana-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, then hath been done for it (as far as I can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand)

                  <hi>follows, that Infants are capable of Baptiſm, though it ſhould be granted, that the love of God is the originall ground of rendring perſons capable thereof: And the reaſon of this deniall is taken from that difference which is between the originall ground of perſons capabilitie of Baptiſm, and the next immediate ground hereof. For howſoever the love of God be the ground of all diſpenſations of good to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet it is not ſo from the ſelf ſame reſpect: but as it exhibits it ſelf in one diſpenſation of it in one reſpect, ſo in another Diſpenſation thereof it exhibits it ſelf upon other terms and reſpects. And thereforce we muſt diſtinguiſh between the love of God, as it is the ground of Baptiſm. The love of God then is to be conſidered, either 1. in the whole entire ſumme or body of it, generally and indefinitely conſidered, as comprehending and incloſing in it all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diſpenſations of Grace towards the creature; or elſe, 2. as it excites or puts forth it ſelf in thoſe particular diſpenſations themſelves. The love of God in the former ſence, though it be the the ground of all particular acts of Grace, and ſo that alſo which appertains to Baptiſm, yet is it no ſound way of reaſoning, to conclude perſons to be in an immediate capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of Baptiſm, becauſe they are in the love of God under this generall conſideration. For upon the ſame ground men might as well argue infants to be ſtrong Chriſtians, or fit to be choſen Paſtors, Teachers, or Deacons, as to argue them capable of Baptiſm, becauſe perſons are in theſe capacities by vertue of the love of God to them. And yet who ſees not how abſurd it would be to reaſon thus: If the love of God to perſons be the originall ground which renders them capable of being choſen into the office of Paſtor, Teacher, or Deacon, then Infants are capable of being choſen into theſe Offices,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:118706:233"/> becauſe they are in the love of God, &amp;c. If the love of God to perſons be the originall ground of rendring them capable of the denomination of strong Chriſtians, then Infants are capable of the denomination of ſtrong Chriſtians, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are in that love and favour of God. But, &amp;c.</hi>—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the light then of theſe Inſtances, the invaliditie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed abſurdity, of concluding Infants to be capable of Baptiſm, becauſe they are in that love and favour of God, may (you ſee) be ſufficiently diſcerned.</hi>

               <p>Never did there a more impertinent piece of diſcourſe ſhew it ſelf on paper, then this: and yet what joy doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Anſwer."/> Mr. <hi>A.</hi> make in the winding of it up. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. It runs all along upon a palpable and wide miſtake of the Argument, unto which it pretends the relation of an Anſwer (as was lately obſerved.) Infant bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers argue Infants capable of Baptiſm from their relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Son-ſhip unto God: Mr. <hi>A.</hi> anſwers, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to prove (though very unhandſomely too) that the love of God to them doth not render them capable thereof; as if the relation in men of Son-ſhip unto God, and the love which is in God towards men, were one &amp; the ſame thing. May not a man as well ſuppoſe, that the ſilver which is in my purſe, and the gold which in his, is one and the ſame thing?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Argument which Mr. <hi>A.</hi> ſhould anſwer, buildeth a baptiſmal capacity in Infants, upon that which it calleth the originall or firſt gound, or qualification for Baptiſm in the creature, which it affirmeth to be, the relation ſpecified (Son-ſhip unto God) and this in oppoſition to Faith and Repentance: Mr. <hi>A's</hi> anſwer diſcourſeth of the originall ground of the diſpenſation, in God: which, being interpreted, is nothing at all to the purpoſe. By the way, when the Argument, with the Anſwer, whereof Mr. <hi>A</hi> hath at preſent both his hands full, aſſerteth the relation of Son-ſhip unto God, to be the originall or firſt ground, or qualification for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm;
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:118706:233"/> it doth not take <hi>originall, or firſt,</hi> in oppoſition to immediate or next, but in oppoſition to that, which is after, and ſubordinate. So that it avoucheth Son-ſhip in children to be every whit as neer, as immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a ground of Baptiſm, as Faith, or Repentance, or a declaration of either, or a deſire it ſelf of Baptiſm, are in perſons capable of ſuch things. Yea and ſuppoſeth, that neither Faith, nor Repentance, nor a Declaration of either, are any grounds or qvalifications for Baptiſm at all, but only as they make, and declare their ſubjects, men and women, the children of God.

               <p n="1">1.

That which his Antagoniſts hold about this latter point is, that the relation of Son-ſhip, which by the Grace of God working in that rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption which is by Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues unto Infants naturally deſcending from <hi>Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by, or from, the pardon of the ſin he ſpeaks of, partly alſo from that immunitie from actuall tranſgreſſion,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:118706:235"/> which is found in Infants, renders them actually, or immediately, capable of Baptiſm. Even as it is the ſame Son-ſhip in perſons of diſcretion, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in part, accruing (as <hi>viz.</hi> from the remiſſion of their ſins, both originall, and actuall, thorow belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving) which being made known, or apprehended by the Miniſters of Baptiſm, inveſts them with an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate capacitie of the Ordinance.

               <p n="4">4. Neither is it ſo broad a truth, as his meaſure ſeems to make it, that <hi>that act of Grace, of which infants partake is ſuch as is vouchſafed them in the pardon of originall ſin ONLY.</hi> For the relation, or prerogative, of Son-ſhip, and, the <hi>pardon of Originall ſin,</hi> are not one and the ſame <hi>act of Grace,</hi> nor yet one and the ſame benefit, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.

               <p>
                  <hi>That that act, or thoſe acts of Grace, unto which Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm doth appropriately belong, is the pardon of ſin upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſuch other acts of grace as are concomitant</hi>

                  <hi>and conſequentiall hereunto, appears plainly by this,</hi> viz. <hi>in that Baptiſm is called (according to the nature of it, and the intent of God in its inſtitution) the Baptiſm of repentance for the Remiſſion of ſins. That is, that Baptiſm which is to be received upon mens repentance for the remiſſion of ſins; or that Baptiſm, in and by which men profeſſe that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect remiſſion of ſins in the way of Repentance: or becauſe the reception of which Baptiſm proceeds from a principle of Repentance</hi> [this clauſe is no good ſence] <hi>or elſe becauſe God therein doth authentically aſſure men of the remiſſion of
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:118706:235"/> their ſins upon their Repentance. Take it which way you will, it proves this, that Baptiſm is converſant about, and ſubſervient unto, that act of Gods grace and love, which is vouchſafed unto men in the pardon of their ſins upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.

               <p n="1">1. The concluſion, which Mr. <hi>A.</hi> works after in the fore-part of this parcell of diſcourſe, and which he draws up in the laſts words hereof (now recited) <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Baptiſm is irrelative to the grace of God in the pardon of Infants ſin,</hi> may be granted him, with this explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that that which Baptiſm, when adminiſtred unto Infants, properly and immediately relateth unto, is not <hi>the grace of God in the pardon of their ſinne,</hi> but the grace of God in inveſting them with the priviledge of Sons. Which, whether in order of nature, it be antecedaneous, or ſubſequentiall, to the other (the pardon of their ſin) may be argued to and fro: I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the latter. But if his meaning be, that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is ſimply, univerſally, and in every reſpect, <hi>irrelative to the grace of God in the pardon of Infants ſin,</hi> this is a crow which remains to be pull'd.

               <p n="3">3. Whereas he makes <hi>Baptiſm appropriately to belong,</hi> not only <hi>to the pardon of ſin upon repentance,</hi> but <hi>unto other
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:118706:236"/> acts of grace alſo concomitant and conſequentiall thereunto,</hi> doth he not ſeem to lean either towards the <hi>Clinicall</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, who were wont not to adminiſter Baptiſm, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perſons on their ſick beds, and (as the Papiſts their extream unction) in the approach of death; or elſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Hemerobaptiſts,</hi> who judged it neceſſary to be every day baptized, and practiſed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly?

               <p>5. (And laſtly) To give Mr. <hi>A.</hi> an account, why Baptiſm is thus held forth, or deſcribed in the Scripture, <hi>the Baptiſm of repentance for the remiſſion of ſins</hi> (words, I confeſſe which face his Anti-paedo-baptiſmall conceit more plauſibly, then any thing beſides in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, although they have nothing in heart for it) it is to be conſidered, that the Goſpell, being to be preached only unto perſons of years, who only are capable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it, and from whom only obedience is expected unto it, is drawn up by the holy Ghoſt (in the generall frame and carriage of it) with ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto theſe, notwithſtanding many things in it relate unto Infants and children, and their benefit by the grace of it. Hence it is that many things are here requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as ſimply, abſolutely, and univerſally neceſſary unto ſalvation; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they are thus neceſſary in reſpect
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:118706:236"/> of thoſe to whom the goſpell is to be preached, and that are capable of performing them, as perſons of years and underſtanding: but Infants, as ſuch, and whilſt ſuch, and children, are never the more ſubjected to this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity: As when the Goſpel threatneth, <hi>He that believeth not</hi> [i. whoſoever believeth not <hi>ſhall be damned,</hi> the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is calculated for men &amp; wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only: nor is it any part of the intent or meaning of it, that Infants not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ſhall be damned. So when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>without holineſſe</hi> [or rather, without the purchaſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe] <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>none,</hi> or no perſon <hi>ſhall ſee the Lord</hi> (Heb. 12. 14.) children are not hereby ſubjected to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſpecified, to inveſt them with a capacitie of <hi>ſeeing the Lord,</hi> but men and women only. So again, when <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>whoſoever doth not righteouſneſſe, is not of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>neither he that loveth not his Brother,</hi> it cannot be from hence concluded, that children <hi>are not of God,</hi> or are not the children of God, and upon this account, his he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs, although they <hi>do not righteouſneſſe,</hi> nor yet <hi>love their brother.</hi> This method and ſtrain of the Goſpel might be exemplified in very many paſſages and inſtances more. In like manner, becauſe the Doctrine of Baptiſm was and is, to be taught and preached unto men and women only, theſe only being of capacitie to underſtand it, therefore is Baptiſm deſcribed and ſet forth in the ſcripture, as it relateth unto them, and their conditions; <hi>viz.</hi> as a ſacred pledg from God to aſſure them of the high priviledg and bleſſing of remiſſion of ſins upon their repentance. But this no more proveth that the adminiſtration of it belongeth not unto Infants, becauſe they do not repent, then this ſaying, <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> proveth that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation belongeth not unto Infants, becauſe they do not believe. Upon alike account, becauſe the Doctrine of Circumciſion, and of the counſell of God in it, was to be declared and preached only unto perſons of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, therefore the ſcripture deſcribeth it, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſpeaketh of it, under that relation and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:118706:237"/> wherein it related unto men, as where it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, to have been <hi>a ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of Faith.</hi> [See Sect. 61, 64.] even as Baptiſm is termed or deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, <hi>the Baptiſm of Repentance for the remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> [which two deſcriptions we formerly ſcanned, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, Sect. 61.] ſo again, where God ſaith to the <hi>Jews, Circumciſe your ſelves to the Lord, and take away the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkin of your hearts,</hi> Jer. 4. 4. and again, <hi>it ſhall be a token of the Covenant between me and you,</hi> Gen. 17. 11. (to omit other places) Theſe and ſeverall other like paſſages and ſayings notwithſtanding, which repreſent Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon no other terms, nor in any other conſideration then as appropriable and appliable unto men, yet children (we know) were the more appropriate ſubject of the adminiſtration thereof. In like manner, though it ſhould be granted, that Baptiſm be deſcribed under ſuch a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherein it is only ſerviceable &amp; appropriable unto men and women, who are capable of Repentance, and of Remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſins hereupon, yet this no way proveth, nor ſo much as lightly intimateth, that therefore Infants are not the regular, yea, or not the more proper and convenient ſubject hereof, ordinarily.</p>

In as much then as Baptiſm is not beneficiall unto any, but by means of their Faith, and anſwer of a good conſcience; and in as much alſo that Infants are not under this capacitie of means, both which I have formerly evidently proved; therefore it follows unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably, that God doth not love Infants upon any ſuch terms, as he doth thoſe unto whom he commends and communicates his love in, and by, Baptiſm: and conſequently, that the love which God bears to Infants, puts them into no immediate capacitie of Baptiſm.</hi>

                  <hi>ſinne, and the putting them into a condition of Salvation by Chriſt: all which love of God they are inveſted with, before ever Baptiſm can be applied unto them. Becauſe the love of God in this reſpect is not conditionall, nor does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the action of any creature, or application of any means, but ſolely upon the attonement which Chriſt hath made on that behalf. And therefore Baptiſm lies out of the verge, compaſſe, circumference of the love of God as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by Infants, and contributes neither leſſe nor more in that diſpenſation of Gods love unto them. In which reſpect alſo Baptiſm is irrelative to the love of God in that preciſe conſideration of it in which it is communicated unto Infants.</hi> Thus farre Mr. <hi>A.</hi> in an <hi>Aenigma</hi> in this place: and as farre as I underſtand the Riddle, I ſhall aſſoil it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I am not able to comprehend what he drives at, nor where the thred of reaſon reaſon runs, in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Only I perceive that he works upon his former miſtake, ſuppoſing that his Adverſaries argue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Baptiſmall capacitie in Children from the love which God ſheweth unto them in the pardon of their guilt in <hi>Adams</hi> ſin. But</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas he ſaith, that <hi>Infants are inveſted with all that love of God which conſiſts only in the pardon of original ſinne, and the putting them into a condition of Salvation by CHRIST, before ever Baptiſm can be applyed to them,</hi> I am ſo dull of hearing, that, I cannot conceive which way this would operate, or what it deſires to produce. The beſt of my conjectures at this turn, is, that becauſe <hi>the extent of the love of God to Infants,</hi> of which the Major Propoſition ſpeaks, <hi>conſiſts in the pardon of Originall ſinne,</hi> and is vouchſafed unto them <hi>before Baptiſm can be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them,</hi> therefore the application of it unto them, is ſuperfluous and vain.

               <p n="1">1. That that which immediatly qualifies any Subject whatſoever for Baptiſm, is ſomewhat already in being in this ſubject, before <hi>Baptiſm be applyed unto it,</hi> not any capacity in in to receive ſomewhat, by, or after, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. It is true, there is no ſubject duly qualified for Baptiſm, but what is in a capacitie of receiving benefit, after, and by means of, his baptizing; and it hath been proved over and over, that Infants are in ſuch a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as this, aſwell as men. But however, it is not ſuch a capacitie as this, which qualifieth either the one, or the other, for Baptiſm: for then all perſons whatſoever of mankind, young and old, ſhould be qualified for it, inaſmuch as they are all in ſome capacity this way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That although it ſhould be granted, or could be ſuppoſed, that Infants are in no capacitie of any additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall love of God by means of Baptiſm, beyond what they are poſſeſſed of before; yet ſuppoſing withall, that their Parents may receive any additionall comfort concerning the Grace and Love of God towards them, by means of their Baptizing, or that they judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeves bound in Conſcience to procure, or indeavour their baptizing (neither of which is any unreaſonable ſuppoſition) it will not follow that the application of Baptiſm unto them ſhould be ſuperfluous or vain. But I am here in the dark: only here is a ſufficiencie of light whereby to diſcern that in this paragraph here is neither little nor much to comfort the heart of Mr. <hi>A's</hi> fainting cauſe, under the burthen of that Argument, that lies ſtill ſo hard and heavie upon it.

In this reſpect ſuch a profeſſion of Faith is neceſſary, becauſe without it the love of God to them upon ſuch terms is not knowable, and conſequently they not admittable to Baptiſm, as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proved: by which, Infants, as touching their capabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Baptiſm, are clearly excluded.</hi> This is the firſt advance of Mr. <hi>A's</hi> Anſwer to the proof (as he calls it) of the Minor Propoſition.

The proof he ſpeaks of doth not hold a neceſſitie of Faith in the perſons mentioned, to render them known to thoſe, who are to baptize them, for perſons being in the love God. To be in the love of God, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a love in God born towards them, not any thing in them towards God. Now it hath been oft ſaid, that that which immediately and formally qualifieth for Baptiſm, muſt be ſomewhat in the creature or

               <p n="3">3. If he did baptize him upon the account of his Faith, then before his baptizing him, he muſt be conceived to have reaſoned thus within himſelf.

The major in this argument ſhineth ſufficiently with its own light. The minor is evident from hence; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe <hi>John</hi> knew as wel before his prohibiting him his baptiſm, or refuſing to baptize him, that he beleeved himſelf to be the Son of God, as afterwards, when he yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to baptize him; and yet (as we ſee) refuſed to baptize him, notwithſtanding the knowledg he had of ſuch a belief in him. Therefore certainly he did not baptize him upon the account of his Faith. Nor did <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>interim</hi> (I mean, between <hi>John</hi>'s refuſing to baptize him, and his admitting him unto his Baptiſm) any wayes inform <hi>John,</hi> that ſince he beleeved himſelf to be the Son of God, he lawfully might, or of duty ought, to baptize him. So that on which ſide ſoever

                  </gap> Baptiſm, did as well know that he was the Son of God, as that he beleeved himſelf to be Son of God; and yet did not upon this account baptize him. Therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenor of your late reaſoning, neither did he baptize him upon the account of his being in favour with God, or of his relation of Sonſhip unto God. To this I anſwer, that although <hi>John</hi> knew <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be the Son of God when he declined the baptizing him as well as afterwards when he baptized him, yet (it ſeems) he did not at preſent ſo wel conſider, that he being the only begotten Son of God, and ſo a perſon in dignity infinitely tranſcending other men, it was meet for him being a weak and ſinful man to baptize him, until the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf admoniſhed or informed him of the meetneſs of the thing, the tranſcendent dignity of his perſon notwithſtanding. <hi>Suffer it to be ſo now; for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteouſneſs</hi> (Mat. 3. 15.) as if he ſhould have ſaid: How true ſoever it be, which thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeſt againſt thy baptizing me, as <hi>viz.</hi> that thou <hi>hast need to be baptized of me,</hi> and not I of thee, yet be content to do what at this time, and upon the preſent occaſion, I deſire of thee, becauſe it becometh me, notwithſtanding the peculiar dignity of my perſon, yet in reſpect of my mediatory under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, to condeſcend to every thing which is righteous, or meet for other men to ſubmit unto.

               <p>Now that other perſons are not regularly admittable unto Baptiſm, nor ever were in the Apoſtles times admitted here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, ſimply and meerly, as, or becauſe Beleevers, but as, or becauſe their faith, thorough the profeſſion of it, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare them to be the Sons of God, and ſo i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. If beleeving <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be the Son of God, gives a regular capacity of Baptiſm, as it is ſimply beleeving, and not as it declares the Beleever to be the Son of God, and in ſpecial favour with him, then is the Devil himſelfe, or at leaſt may be in a regular capacity of being baptized. The reaſon of this conſequence is evident; becauſe he beleeves <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be the Son of God, or at leaſt is a ſufficient capacity to believe it. The Apoſtle ſaith that <hi>he was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily</hi> [or with power] <hi>declared to be the Son of God, according to the ſpirit of holineſſe; by the reſurrection from the dead.</hi> Now the devil is very capable of any rational demonſtration. how much more of ſuch, which are pregnant, and full of power to convince? And though he be <hi>a lyar, and the Father thereof,</hi> yet being ſubtile and wiſe in his generation, he is not like to lye to his own diſadvantage: which yet he muſt be ſuppoſed to have done, when he ſaid unto Chriſt, <hi>I know thee who thou art, the holy one of God,</hi> (Mark 1. 24.) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now that the Devil is, or may be, in a regular capacity of being baptized is (I preſume) none of Mr. <hi>A's</hi> thoughts. Therefore believing, ſimply as beleeving, doth not qualifie for baptiſme but as it ſelfe being profeſſed or declared, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth the Profeſſour of it to be a child of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If believing, ſimply, as believing, inrights unto baptiſm, then did <hi>Philip</hi> put the <hi>Eunuch</hi> upon harder and ſtricter termes to ſatisfie himſelfe about his meetneſſe to be baptized, when upon this account he required of him, or impoſed on him, a <hi>beleeving with the whole heart</hi>) Act 8. 37.) then his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:118706:246"/> in that behalfe allowed him to do. And (indeed) his admoniſhi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If ſo, then it readily follows, that it is the relation of Son-ſhip unto God, which originally, primarily, and directly inveſteth with this capacity, and that whereſoever, and in whomſoever this may reaſonably be preſumed to be there is as rich, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular a capacity of baptiſme, as beleeving by means of the profeſſion of it, can give unto any man. And that it is the property of Faith to give unto men the relation we ſpeak of (I mean, of Son-ſhip unto God) is the loud vote of the Scripture from place to place, <hi>Joh. 1. 12. Gal.</hi> 3, 26. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. And if Faith gives the relation of Son-ſhip, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion or declaration of Faith, muſt needs give knowledge of this relation unto men.</p>

               <p>If it be here replyed; true it is, Faith profeſſed declareth a perſon to be the Son of God; but it followeth not from hence, that therefore it qualifieth for baptiſme in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: I anſwer; if this be the nobleſt and higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration in Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> that it gives the relation of Son-ſhip unto God, makes a man or a woman to become a child of God (which I ſuppoſe is no mans queſtion) then muſt it needs be the higheſt conſideration alſo in the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, that it declares a man or woman to be the childe of God. And if theſe things be ſo, it undeniably followeth, that either it is ſomwhat that it is meaner and lower in Faith (and ſo in the profeſſion of Faith) which inſtates men in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of Baptiſm, or elſe that it is that relative &amp; declarative nature in it of which we ſpeak, which thus enſtateth them. Now then if Baptiſm be to be looked upon as a matter of favour, or priviledge vouchſafed by God unto men, or unto
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:118706:246"/> his children, it is unreaſonable to conceive or think that he ſhould conferre it upon the account of that which is meaner, and leſſe conſiderable in them, paſſing by that which is more excellent, more conſiderable and worthy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If faith giveth not right unto Baptiſm in that declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive conſideration mentioned, then giveth it in ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration relating to it; as (for example) either as it is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply an act, or as it is ſuch, or ſuch a kind of act, or as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth to ſuch or ſuch an object, or the like. But there is no other conſideration in Faith, by vertue whereof it can ſo much as tolerably be conceived that it ſhould give a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of Baptiſm: Therefore it muſt needs be conceived to give this capacity in the conſideration ſpecified.</p>
               <p>Nor can it here reaſonably be pretended, in oppoſition to what hath been ſaid, that it gives the capacity now conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded about, in conſideration of the ordinance or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, that ſo it ſhould do, or that by vertue of ſuch a divine ordinance as this, it gives the ſaid capacity.

               <p>1. When we affirm that it gives the capacity ſo oft ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by vertue of the declarative property of it (frequently likewiſe mentioned) we do not exclude the ordinance, or appointment of God in this behalfe but ſuppoſe or include it altogether. We believe that faith doth not juſtifie, or make a child of God, but by vertue of the will, appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ordination of God in this kind: nor do we beleeve that it gives the capacity of Baptiſm, upon any other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>2. Whenſoever God by the counſel of his will, or by his appointment, ſettleth any priviledge or benefactory pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, upon any grace, act, or ſervice of his creature. he doth it ſtil in conſideration of, or with an eye unto, ſomething that is conſiderable in, or about this Grace, act or ſervice, which commendeth it unto him as meet and proper for an inveſtiture with ſuch a priviledge. He doth not inveſt every Grace, or every ſervice, with every priviledge: but confers priviledges with an exact proportion to each Grace, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:118706:247"/> priviledged by him, in reſpect of ſome thing or other conſiderable in them in reference to ſuch a collation. Now then when we affirm and ſay, that faith gives a right unto Baptiſm as it is declarative of Son-ſhip unto God, our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that this declarative property is that conſideration in it, in regard whereof God judged it meet to be inveſted with ſuch a priviledge, as to give a capacity of, or a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to baptiſm unto all thoſe in whom it ſhould be found, and hath inveſted it accordingly.</p>
               <p>Thus then, all things duly weighed and conſidered, it fully appeareth, that the device which Mr. <hi>A</hi> imagined againſt the argument or objection, lately propounded by himſelfe, is too great for him to perform. By the light of all theſe late diſcuſſion it is ſufficiently evident, that faith in no other conſiderations intrinſically appertaining to it, gives a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Baptiſm, but onely as it is declarative of Sonſhip and that this is the original and proper qualification for Baptiſm; and that being by any probable (much more by any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative) argument made known unto thoſe, who have a right to baptiſe, baptiſme ought not to be denied unto it.</p>
               <p>Whereas Mr. <hi>A.</hi> very operouſly, and with the quotation of many Scriptures, labours to prove the <hi>Eunuch's</hi> Faith, <hi>I beleeve Jeſus Chriſt to be the ſon of God,</hi> was <hi>none other then the Faith of the Goſpel, and the common form of Beleevers confeſſion:</hi> and again, that <hi>Christ had this Faith,</hi> i. e. <hi>that he beleeved himſelfe to be the Son of God;</hi> he might to as much purpoſe, and (well nigh) with as much pertinence to his cauſe, have ſpent his paines in proving the Sun to be up at noon day. If he could have proved, Firſt that Chriſt's faith was of the ſame nature and conſideration with the Faith of beleevers; And ſecondly, that he was baptized by <hi>John</hi> upon the account of this his Faith, ſimply and abſolutely conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he had made the face of his cauſe to ſhine (at leaſt to a degree) but being defective in theſe, his labour and coſt otherwiſe ſignifie nothing.</p>

               <p>What he ſpeaks afterward, concerning <hi>Chriſt making a dedication of himſelfe unto the ſervice of profeſſing and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:118706:247"/> the Goſpel, by the ſolemnity of baptiſme, as others did and ought to do;</hi> he ſpeaks upon no ſteady, no nor probable, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in reaſon. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> (doubtleſſe) had made a <hi>dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of himſelfe</hi> to the <hi>ſervice</hi> he ſpeaks of long before his receiving the <hi>ſolemnity of Baptiſm:</hi> yea and had profeſſed the Goſpel, and declared himſelf the Son of God. For being yet but twelve years old, he was found in the Temple diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the things of God amongſt the Doctors (ſo called) of thoſe times. And to his Parents his Mother ſaying thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Son, why haſt thou dealt thus with us? behold thy Father and I have ſought thee ſorrowing,</hi> he returned this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>How is it that ye ſought me? wiſt ye not that I muſt be about my Fathers buſineſſe?</hi> (Luke 2. 46. 49.) So that now he both profeſſed himſelfe to be the Son of God, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red alſo that he had dedicated and devoted himſelfe to that work of his, about which he was ſent, whereas he was not baptized till about the thirtieth year of his life, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 21. 23. Or if Mr. <hi>A's.</hi> meaning be, that <hi>Chriſt was</hi> now <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth into the world to profeſſe and publiſh the Goſpel</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly when he was baptized, the expreſſe letter of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Hiſtory riſeth up againſt him. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not thus profeſs or publiſh the Goſpel, untill <hi>Johns</hi> caſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to priſon (<hi>Matth. 4. 12. 7. Mark</hi> 1. 14.) which was ſome conſiderable time after his baptizing: for preſently after his baptizing he was led by the ſpirit into the wilderneſs, and there continued forty days and forty nights amongſt the wild beaſts (<hi>Mark 1. 13. Matth.</hi> 4. 1, 2.) which importeth (as <hi>Theophylact</hi> well obſerveth) that all this time he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch a part of the wilderneſſe, where men were not wont to come. So that all this while he did not <hi>profeſſe or publiſh the Goſpel</hi> openly, unleſs it were to the wild beaſts, or the Devil. Nor can it be proved that <hi>Johns</hi> caſting into priſon immediately followed the abode of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the wilderneſs: indeed the contrary appeareth from the Scriptures; yet ſhal we not argue this at preſent: So that M. <hi>A.</hi> is out of the way of truth at this turn alſo. Why Chriſt deferred his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to that time, when he received it, may be ſhewed in the progreſs of this anſwer very ſpeedily.</p>
               <pb n="396" facs="tcp:118706:248"/>
               <p>But however <hi>Paedo-baptiſts</hi> claim countenance to their practice from the baptiſme of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Mr. <hi>A.</hi> hath a conceit that from it he can <hi>frame an argument againſt</hi> their practiſe, and this (as he ſaith) <hi>without wreſting it;</hi> as if it were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a ſingular thing with him to argue againſt his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries without wreſting the Scriptures, which he manageth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.

               <p>2. That which this argument taketh for granted, and upon which the whole ſtreſs of it reſteth, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be baptized at that <hi>ſeaſon, and upon that occaſion, when he began to profeſs, and publiſh the Goſpel, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> hath been lately caſhiered upon the delinquencie of errour found in it.</p>
               <p>The true reaſon (to give knowledge of this by the way) why Chriſt was baptized at that ſeaſon, of which he now made choice for that purpoſe, was (as the Evangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> ſeems to inſinuate, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 21.) that in the midſt of that great confluence of people which came unto <hi>John</hi> to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, he might receive a teſtimonie from heaven, that he was the Son of God. This account of the time or ſeaſon of his baptiſm, was given by <hi>Hierom</hi> long ago. The context in <hi>Luke</hi> very much favoureth it. <hi>Now when all the people were
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:118706:249"/> baptized, it came to paſſe that Jeſus alſo being baptized, and praying, the Heaven was opened, and the Holy Ghoſt deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a bodily ſhape like a Dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven which ſaid, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleaſed,</hi> Luk. 3: 21, 22. The multitude of thoſe, who came unto <hi>John</hi> to be baptized (and were now baptized ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly) is here mentioned,</p>
               <p n="1">1. As the occaſion of <hi>Chriſts</hi> coming to be baptized (and of his baptiſm accordingly) and,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Together with this baptiſm of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as an occaſion, both of the opening of the heaven, and of the deſcent of the holy Ghoſt in a viſible ſhape upon him, and (as the end of theſe two) of that voice that came from heaven and ſaid, <hi>Thou art my beloved Son,</hi> &amp;c. The Evangeliſt <hi>Mathew</hi> alſo (c. 3. 13. compared with the foregoing part of the Chapter) glanceth a like intimation: For having firſt reported, the great numbers that had been baptized by <hi>John,</hi> as viz. <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan,</hi> ver. 5, 6. ſubjoyning the tenor of <hi>Johns</hi> Doctrine and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to thoſe that had been baptized by him, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. He taketh notice, <hi>v.</hi> 13. that <hi>Chriſt</hi> took this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for his comming unto <hi>John</hi> to be baptized of him: <hi>THEN cometh Jeſus from Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him: THEN,</hi> viz. when, and whilſt thoſe who repaired unto <hi>John</hi>'s baptiſm, were in greateſt numbers about him, and attending on his Doctrine.</p>

               <p>The reaſon or occaſion now aſſign'd of <hi>Chriſts</hi> delaying his Baptiſm until the time when he accepted it, hath (as we have ſhewed) a ground in the Scriptures; whereas that pretended by Mr. <hi>A. viz.

               <hi>Poſtcript, for the finiſhing of Sect. 25. p.</hi> 133.</head>
            <p>TO ſay that <hi>Chriſt</hi> bleſſed theſe children as ſymbolical or typical reſemblances of the humility and docility of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> converts, or in ſuch a ſence as he is ſaid to have bleſſed the elements in the Sacrament, <hi>Mat. 26. 26. Mar.</hi> 14. 22. not as perſons really capable of any true ſpiritual bleſſing, is (it ſeems) a late Apocryphal, and empty ſhift found out by ſome of the Maſters of the Ana-baptiſmal perſwaſion, to help their lame cauſe over this ſtile. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Scripture no where ſo much as whiſpers this noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I mean, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> bleſſed the children brought unto him no otherwiſe, then as types onely, and as he bleſſed the Bread in the Sacrament. There is neither precept, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the Scriptures, nor any good conſequence from any part of Scripture, ſo much as to colour ſuch a conceit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Did <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſſe <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> (the ſons of <hi>Joſeph</hi>) typically, or as <hi>Chriſt</hi> afterwards bleſſed the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Bread? or if he bleſſed them as perſons really capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch good things, as mankind, or reaſonable creatures are capable of, and this his bleſſing them was not fruitleſs or in vain, but they really proſpered upon the account of it; can we imagine that the bleſſing of <hi>Chriſt</hi> conferr'd upon the children brought to him, ſhould turn to ſo inconſiderable an account unto them, as to benefit them no otherwiſe, then as inanimate and ſenſleſs things may receive benefit? The like demand might be made concerning <hi>Moſes</hi> his bleſſing the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> before his death, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 1.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt</hi> pleading the cauſe of thoſe who brought the children unto him, againſt his Diſciples, who rebuked them, plainly juſtifies the reaſons and grounds of their act in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, which are ſaid to have been, <hi>that he might lay hands on them and pray,</hi> Mat. 19. 13. Therefore (doubtleſs) he did anſwer the deſires and intentions of theſe perſons in that behalf, in what he did unto, and for theſe children. Now it muſt needs be a very weak mans thought, to imagine that they, who brought theſe children unto Chriſt, deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from him on their behalf, better or greater then what ſenceleſs and liveleſs creatures might enjoy, as well as they:
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:118706:253"/> And if he had conferr'd upon them only ſome ſuch thing, as this, he had (certainly) fruſtrated both the deſires and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of thoſe that brought them.</p>
            <p n="4">4 If <hi>Chriſt</hi> had bleſſed theſe children only as emblems or types of Goſpel converts, in caſe Lambs or Doves, or Sheep had been brought unto him likewiſe, he might, upon ſuch an account, as well have layd his hands upon theſe, and bleſſed them, and have ſaid, <hi>Suffer</hi> Lambs and Doves, and Sheep <hi>to come unto me, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God.</hi> But is it meet to make any part of a ſober mans faith, to beleeve or think, that the Lord Chriſt in the caſe ſpecified, would either have done or ſpoken, according to the tenour of theſe things?</p>
            <p n="5">5. (And laſtly) becauſe the conceit we oppoſe, is in it ſelf ſo uncouth and improbable, that it is not like to ride any mans judgement, unleſs he finds it bowed down with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice) the reaſon which <hi>Chriſt</hi> gives for this his order, that <hi>Children ſhould be ſuffered to come unto him,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of his gracious intentions towards them upon their coming, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>of ſuch is the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> This clearly proveth, that the bleſſing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee now bleſſed thoſe children that were brought unto him, and intended to bleſs thoſe that ſhould be brought unto him afterwards, was a bleſſing appropriate unto Saints, or ſuch, who are ſubjects in the Kingdom of God: But the Bread in the Sacrament, is no Saint (though the Papiſts dream it to be the King of Saints) and therefore no capable ſubject of ſuch a bleſſing, which the children obtained by their coming to <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
